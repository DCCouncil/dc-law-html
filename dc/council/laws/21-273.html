            <p>BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Active Duty Pay Differential Amendment Act of 2016".</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;2"><span class="level-num">Sec. 2. </span>Section 1103(a)(7)(A) of the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-139; D.C. Official Code § 1-611.03(a)(7)(A)), is amended to read as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1">"<span class="level-num" id="">(A)</span> Any full-time permanent, indefinite, or term employee of a District agency or independent agency, who serves in a reserve component of the United States Armed Forces and who has been or will be called to active duty in preparation for, or as a result of, Operation New Dawn, Operation Odyssey Dawn, or any contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(13), shall receive, upon application and approval, an amount that equals the difference in compensation between the employee's District government basic pay reduced by the employee's basic military pay.  This amount shall not be considered as basic pay for any purpose and shall be paid for any period following the formal inception of Operation New Dawn in 2010, any period following the formal inception of Operation Odyssey Dawn in 2011, or any period following the formal inception of any contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(13), during which the employee is carried in a non-pay status from the time the employee is called into active duty, until the employee is released from active duty occasioned by any of these military operations, or, in the case of a term employee, until the date of the end of the term of employment.".</p>
