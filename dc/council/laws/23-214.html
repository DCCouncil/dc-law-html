            <p style="font-style: italic">To amend the Vital Records Modernization Amendment Act of 2018 to require the Department of Health to establish a commemorative certificate of stillbirth to be made available at the request of the parent named on a fetal death report registered with the Department of Health, to require the certificate to include appropriate information as determined by the Department, to require a person required to report a fetal death to inform the parent of the availability of a certificate of stillbirth, to prohibit a certificate of stillbirth from being used to constitute a live birth or calculate live birth statistics, to prohibit the creation of liability based on the issuance of a certificate of stillbirth, to limit disclosure and access of the information contained on a certificate of stillbirth, and to allow the Department of Health to charge a fee for a certificate of stillbirth.</p>
            <p>BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Certificate of Stillbirth Amendment Act of 2020".</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> The certificate shall include such appropriate information as determined by the Department and be on a form established by the Department that is similar, as applicable, to a certificate issued for a record of live birth pursuant to <code-cite doc="D.C. Code" path="&#xA7;7-231.08">section 108</code-cite>; provided, that the inclusion of a name given to a stillborn fetus by a parent shall be included only at the election of the parent.</p>

A certificate of stillbirth may be requested and issued regardless of the date on which the fetal death was reported or registered.  Commemorative stillbirth certificates will not be available for events that do not meet the statutory definition for fetal death.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> Following the receipt of the report and registration as a fetal death, and upon the request of a parent named on the report, the Registrar shall issue a certificate of stillbirth within 30 days.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> "Stillbirth" means the delivery of a fetus where there was death before the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of human conception, regardless of the duration of pregnancy.".</p>
