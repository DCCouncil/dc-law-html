            <p style="text-align: center;">AN ACT</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">To amend the West End Parcels Development Omnibus Act of 2010 to clarify the uses of the West End Library and Fire Station Maintenance Fund, and to clarify the roles of the District of Columbia Public Library and the Department of General Services in the managing of the fund.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1">BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "West End Parcels Development Omnibus Amendment Act of 2016".</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;2"><span class="level-num">Sec. 2. </span>Section 4 of the West End Parcels Development Omnibus Act of 2010, effective April 8, 2011 (D.C. Law 18-368; D.C. Official Code § 1-325.181), is amended as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(a)">(a)</span> Subsection (a) is amended to read as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> There is established as a special fund the West End Library and Fire Station Maintenance Fund ("Maintenance Fund"),which shall be used solely to fundthe expenses of providing: supplemental maintenance service; common-area maintenance service; insurance; and capital improvements for the West End Library and West End Fire Station (collectively, the "Operating Expenses"). The Maintenance Fund shall supplement such other sums as are annually appropriated for the operation of branch libraries and fire stations, including the West End Library and West End Fire Station, and shall be used solely to ensure that both facilities are maintained in a manner that is consistent with the high-quality conditions of the larger buildings of which they are a part. The Maintenance Fund shall be used first to pay for the Operating Expenses, before other District funds are used, but the Maintenance Fund shall not be used otherwise to supplant local funds typically appropriated for the operation of branch libraries and fire stations.".</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(b)">(b)</span> Subsection (c) is amended by striking the phrase "authorization by Congress" and inserting the word "appropriation" in its place.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(c)">(c)</span> Subsection (d) is amended as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(c)(1)">(1)</span> Paragraph (1) is amended to read as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(1)</span> The Department of General Services, in close consultation with the District of Columbia Public Library, shall manage the Maintenance Fund.  To the extent that monies are needed to pay for the Operating Expenses, in addition to the Maintenance Fund, for the West End Library and the West End Fire Station, the additional monies appropriated for that purpose shall be allocated between the West End Library and West End Fire Station based upon each facility's respective proportionate share of the total annual aggregate Operating Expenses, as jointly determined by the Chief Librarian of the District of Columbia Public Library and the Director of the Department of General Services.".</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(c)(2)">(2)</span> Paragraph (2) is amended by striking the phrase "from the Fund.  Any monies received" and inserting the phrase "from the Fund.  This request shall be prepared for the Mayor by the Department of General Services working in close consultation with the District of Columbia Public Library. The appropriation for expenditures from the Maintenance Fund shall be depicted as a separate activity within the budget of the Department of General Services.  Any monies received" in its place.</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;3"><span class="level-num">Sec. 3. </span>Fiscal impact statement.</p>
            <p>The Council adopts the fiscal impact statement in the committee report as the fiscal impact statement required by section 4a of the General Legislative Procedures Act of 1975, approved October 16, 2006 (120 Stat. 2038; D.C. Official Code § 1-301.47a).</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;4"><span class="level-num">Sec. 4. </span>Effective date.</p>
            <p>This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto), a 30-day period of congressional review as provided in section 602(c)(1) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 813; D.C. Official Code § 1-206.02(c)(1)), and publication in the District of Columbia Register.</p>
