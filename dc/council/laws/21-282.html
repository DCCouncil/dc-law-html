            <p style="text-align: center;">AN ACT</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">To designate an official fish of the District of Columbia, to designate an official amphipod of the District of Columbia, to require the Mayor to designate and regulate critical areas for environmental protection, to require the Mayor to issue regulations requiring shoreline protection measures, to require the Mayor to issue regulations that list invasive plants and nonindigenous nuisance species, to prohibit certain activities relating to invasive plants and nonindigenous nuisance species listed by the Mayor, to authorize the Mayor to issue authorizations to covered establishments to sell fishing licenses and licensure endorsements for recreational fishing in District waters, to authorize the Mayor to authorize and license the possession, transport, and use of certain implements for the capture or killing of fish, and to authorize the Mayor to issue a fish consumption advisory; to amend the Water Pollution Control Act of 1984 to authorize the Mayor to manage fishing seasons by administrative orders and to establish a Fishing License Fund; to amend the Department of Energy and Environment Establishment Act of 2005 to expand the duties of the Department of Energy and Environment ("DOEE") and the Director of the DOEE, and to designate the Director of the DOEE as the District's natural resources trustee; to amend An Act To revise and modernize the fish and game laws of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes to expand protection for amphibians and invertebrates; and to amend Office of Administrative Hearings Establishment Act of 2001 to authorize the Office of Administrative Hearings to adjudicate cases involving the modification, suspension, revocation, or denial of certain permits and authorizations issued under this act.</p>
            <p>BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Fisheries and Wildlife Omnibus Amendment Act of 2016".</p>
            <h1>TITLE I. NATURAL RESOURCES EDUCATION</h1>
            <p id="&#xA7;101"><span class="level-num">Sec. 101. </span>Official fish of the District of Columbia.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;101(a)">(a)</span> The American shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) is an anadromous species of game fish native to the eastern United States and Canada. Spending much of their lives at sea, American shad leave the ocean to find river systems and migrate, or "run," upstream into freshwater environments to spawn in their birthplaces, including the Potomac River.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;101(b)">(b)</span> Once abundant in the Potomac River watershed and considered one of the most valuable commercial fisheries in the United States, the American shad has experienced species-threatening declines throughout the entirety of its native range. A combination of factors have contributed to these declines, such as overfishing, degraded water quality, the recovery of shad predator species, the closing of historic shad spawning waters, and the building of dams for hydroelectric power.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;101(c)">(c)</span> In response to American shad population declines, the District and others, beginning in 2005, undertook restoration activities, including education, reopening fish passages, manual spawning, chemical marking, stocking, and identification. Since restoration efforts began, more than 10 miles of closed spawning surface waters have been opened and more than 10 million American shad hatchlings have been manually spawned and released.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;101(d)">(d)</span> In 2011, the Potomac River Fisheries Commission reported that American shad population targets for the Potomac River established by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission have been met and that the American shad population for the Potomac River had recovered. The District will continue its restoration efforts to ensure the future of the species.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;101(e)">(e)</span> The American shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) is hereby designated the official fish of the District of Columbia.</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;102"><span class="level-num">Sec. 102. </span>Official amphipod of the District of Columbia.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;102(a)">(a)</span> The Hay's Spring amphipod (<em>Stygobromus hayi</em>) is a federally-endangered, globally-rare species of crustacean that is native to, and found only in, a few springs within the District's portion of the Rock Creek watershed.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;102(b)">(b)</span> Spending most of its life underground, the Hay's Spring amphipod lives in groundwater seeps.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;102(c)">(c)</span> The Hay's Spring amphipod measures 5-10 millimeters in length, and is colorless and blind because it lives underground.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;102(d)">(d)</span> The species is highly sensitive to groundwater contaminants and is therefore a strong indicator of the health of the District's natural ecosystems, especially Rock Creek and Rock Creek Park.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;102(e)">(e)</span> The Hay's Spring amphipod (<em>Stygobromus hayi</em>) is hereby designated the official amphipod of the District of Columbia.</p>
