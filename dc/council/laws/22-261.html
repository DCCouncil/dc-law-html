Dense breast tissue can, however, make it more difficult to detect cancers in the breast by mammography because it can hide small abnormalities and may be associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. Accordingly, you may benefit from supplementary screening tests, which may include a breast ultrasound screening, or a breast MRI examination, or both, depending on your individual risk factors.</p>
            <p>"This information is given to you to raise your awareness. Use this information to talk to your health care provider about your own risks for breast cancer. At that time, ask your health care provider if additional screening and/or tests may be useful based on your own risk.</p>
            <p>"A report of your results was sent to your health care provider. You should contact your health care provider if you have any questions or concerns about this report.".</p>
