            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(6)</span> The Mayor may reduce the affordable-housing requirements of this section if the proposed disposition of real property finances the development of a significant public facility.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "public facility" means a building, structure, or system that is an asset of the District government eligible for capital spending and subject to depreciation.  A public facility may include a fire station, public library, public school, stadium, or homeless shelter.

If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed amendments to the documents, in whole or in part, by resolution within the 45-day review period, the proposed amendments shall be deemed approved.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> For the purposes of this subsection, the term:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(A)</span> "Redline format" means the changes that are deletions have a line through them and the changes that are additions are underlined.</p>
