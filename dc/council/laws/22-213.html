            <p>"<h3>Article VII. Rules and Operating Procedures: Rulemaking Functions of the Commission and Opting Out of Uniform Standards.</h3></p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> The  Commission  shall  promulgate  reasonable  Rules,  including  Uniform Standards, and Operating Procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> Rules and Operating Procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981, as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission. Before the Commission adopts a Uniform Standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee(s) in each Compacting State responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the Uniform Standard. The Commission in adopting a Uniform Standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> A Uniform Standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation  by  the  Commission  or  such  later  date  as  the  Commission  may  determine; provided, that a Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard as provided in this Article. The term "opt out" shall be defined as any action by a Compacting State to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated Uniform Standard. All other Rules and Operating Procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each Rule, Operating Procedure, or amendment.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(d)</span> A Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the insurance department under the Compacting State's administrative procedure act. If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, it must (i) give written notice to the Commission no later than ten (10) business days after the Uniform Standard is promulgated, or at the time the State becomes a Compacting State, and (ii) find that the Uniform Standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the State, given the conditions in the State. The Commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the State that warrant a departure from the Uniform Standard and determining that the Uniform Standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the State. The Commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the State and needs of the citizens of the State outweigh:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(1)</span> The intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the Products subject to this act; and</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> The presumption that a Uniform Standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant Product.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(e)</span><span class="level-num" id="">(1)</span> Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  a  Compacting  State  may,  at  the  time  of  its enactment of this Compact, prospectively opt out of all Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted Compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any State to participate in this Compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this Compact by the Compacting State and shall apply to all existing Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> In accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the District of Columbia opts out of all existing and prospective uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products in order to preserve the District's statutory requirements governing these insurance products.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(f)</span> If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard, the Uniform Standard shall remain applicable in the Compacting State electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(g)</span> Once the opt out of a Uniform Standard by a Compacting State becomes effective as provided under the laws of that State, the Uniform Standard shall have no further force and effect in that State unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the State. If a Compacting State opts out of a Uniform Standard after the Uniform Standard has been made effective in that State, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV of this Compact for withdrawals.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(h)</span> If a Compacting State has formally initiated the process of opting out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the Compacting State may petition the Commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date of the Uniform  Standard,  to  stay  the  effectiveness  of  the  Uniform  Standard  in  that  State.  The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, that a stay may not be permitted to  remain  in  effect  for  more  than  one  (1)  year  unless  the  Compacting  State  can  show extraordinary circumstances that warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge that prevents the Compacting State from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the Commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(i)</span> Not  later  than  thirty  (30)  days  after  a  Rule  or  Operating  Procedure  is promulgated,  any person  may file  a  petition  for  judicial  review  of  the  Rule  or  Operating Procedure; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the Rule or Operating Procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood  of  success.  The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the Rule or Operating Procedure to be unlawful if the Rule or Operating Procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the Commission's authority.</p>
            <p>"<h3>Article VIII. Commission Records and Enforcement.</h3></p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> The Commission shall promulgate Rules establishing conditions and procedures for  public  inspection  and  copying  of  its  information  and  official  records,  except  such information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets. The Commission may promulgate additional Rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> Except  as  to  privileged  records,  data,  and  information,  the  laws  of  any Compacting  State  pertaining  to  confidentiality  or  nondisclosure  shall  not  relieve  any Compacting  State  Commissioner  of  the  duty  to  disclose  any  relevant  records,  data,  or information to  the Commission;  provided,  that  disclosure to  the Commission  shall  not  be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement; provided further, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this act, the Commission shall not be subject to the Compacting State's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data, and information in its possession. Confidential information of the Commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any Commissioner.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> The Commission shall monitor Compacting States for compliance with duly adopted  Bylaws,  Rules,  including  Uniform  Standards,  and  Operating  Procedures.  The Commission shall notify any non-complying Compacting State in writing of its noncompliance with Commission Bylaws, Rules, or Operating Procedures. If a non-complying Compacting State fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the Compacting State shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in Article XIV.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(d)</span> The Commissioner of any State in which an Insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the Insurer in accordance with the provisions of the State's law. The Commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the Compact is governed by the following provisions:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(1)</span> With respect to the Commissioner's market regulation of a Product or Advertisement that is approved or certified to the Commission, the content of the Product or Advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards, or requirements of the Compact except upon a final order of the Commission issued at the request of a Commissioner after prior notice to the Insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the Commission.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> Before  a  Commissioner  may  bring  an  action  for  violation  of  any provision, standard, or requirement of the Compact relating to the content of an Advertisement not approved or certified to the Commission, the Commission, or an authorized Commission officer or employee, must  authorize  the  action.  However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the Insurer, opportunity for hearing, or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the Commission's action on such requests.</p>
            <p>"<h3>Article IX. Dispute Resolution.</h3></p>
            <p>"The Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a Member, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this Compact that may arise between two (2) or more Compacting States, or between Compacting States and Non-compacting States.  The Commission shall promulgate an Operating Procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.</p>
            <p>"<h3>Article X. Product Filing and Approval.</h3></p>

Nothing in this act shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its Product with the insurance department in any State wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the States where filed.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> The Commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant  to Commission Rules and Operating Procedures.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Commission shall promulgate Rules to establish conditions and  procedures  under  which  the  Commission  will  provide  public  access  to  Product  filing information. In establishing such Rules, the Commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a Product filing or supporting information.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> Any Product approved by the Commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those Compacting States for which the Insurer is legally authorized to do business.</p>
            <p>"<h3>Article XI. Review of Commission Decisions Regarding Filings.</h3></p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> Not later than thirty (30) days after the Commission has given notice of a disapproved Product or Advertisement filed with the Commission, the Insurer or Third Party Filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the Commission. The Commission shall promulgate Rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the Commission in disapproving a Product or Advertisement filed with the Commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law is subject to judicial review in accordance with paragraph (d), Article III.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> The Commission shall have authority to monitor, review, and reconsider Products and Advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the Product does not meet the relevant Uniform Standard.

            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> The Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the Commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the NAIC, Compacting States, and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from  other  sources  shall  be  of  such  a  nature  that  the  independence  of  the  Commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> The Commission shall collect a filing fee from each Insurer and Third Party Filer filing a Product with the Commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the Commission's annual budget.</p>

The  grounds  for  default  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, the failure  of  a Compacting  State  to  perform  its  obligations  or  responsibilities and  any  other  grounds designated in Commission Rules. The Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the Defaulting State's suspension pending a cure of the default. The Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default.
