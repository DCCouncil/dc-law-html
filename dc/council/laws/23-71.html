            <p>BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Go-Go Official Music of the District of Columbia Designation Act of 2020".</p>

            <p id="&#xA7;2"><span class="level-num">Sec. 2. </span>History of Go-Go Music.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(a)">(a)</span> Go-go music originated in the District of Columbia during the mid-1960s to late 1970s.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(b)">(b)</span> Initially, "go-go" was a term used to identify a music club where young people gathered and where, between songs, the percussion section of the band would continue to play while the band leader engaged the audience through melodic call-and-response sessions.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(c)">(c)</span> Go-go is a fusion of musical forms, drawing inspiration from funk, blues, soul, and salsa, and blending them seamlessly, with its syncopated polyrhythms and multiple percussion instruments.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(d)">(d)</span> During the 1980s, the Department of Parks and Recreation "Munch for Lunch" program used its Showmobile, a stage on wheels, to provide free go-go concerts in various locations several times a week for lunchtime crowds to enjoy.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(e)">(e)</span> The 1987 hit "Da Butt" by Chuck Brown and the group Experience Unlimited, also known as E.U., was performed for the soundtrack for Spike Lee's film School Daze, giving Go-Go a national stage.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(f)">(f)</span> Many local residents who went on to join groups such as Rare Essence, Trouble Funk, Junkyard Band, Backyard Band, TCB, TOB, and Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, gained their musical experience in District public-school marching bands.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(g)">(g)</span> Chuck Brown has been repeatedly and officially honored as the "Godfather of Go-Go."</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(h)">(h)</span> Go-go music encapsulates the range of personal experiences in local communities around the District and expresses them in a unifying force.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(i)">(i)</span> Go-go music is a multifaceted art form that fully captures the cultural and artistic expressions of the District.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(j)">(j)</span> Go-go music is hereby designated the official music of the District of Columbia.</p>
