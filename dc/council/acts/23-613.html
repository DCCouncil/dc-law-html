Citizens of the District of Columbia seeking to improve their health and well-being through the use of entheogenic plants and fungi currently use them in fear of arrest and prosecution.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(b)">(b)</span> It is declared that the policy of this act is to make investigation and arrest of adults for non-commercial planting, cultivating, purchasing, transporting, distributing, possessing, or engaging in practices with entheogenic plants and fungi among the lowest law enforcement priorities for the District of Columbia.</p>

Law 4-29; D.C. Official Code § 48-902.04), as among its lowest enforcement priorities.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;3(c)">(c)</span> Nothing in this section shall affect the priority of enforcing any provision of Title I of the Anti-Drunk Driving Act of 1982, effective April 27, 2013 (D.C.
