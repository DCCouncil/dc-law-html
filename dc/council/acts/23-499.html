            <p style="font-style: italic">To amend, on a temporary basis, the Rental Housing Act of 1985 to require a housing provider to serve a written notice to vacate on a tenant before evicting the tenant for any reason, to require a housing provider to provide the tenant with notice of the housing provider's intent to file a claim against a tenant to recover possession of a rental unit at least 30 days before filing the claim, to require the Superior Court to dismiss a claim brought by a housing provider to recover possession of a rental unit where the housing provider, in cases where a notice to quit or a summons and complaint are served by posting on the leased premise, failed to provide the Superior Court with photographic evidence of the posted service, to provide that no tenant shall be evicted from a rental unit for which the housing provider does not have a current business license for rental housing, to require the Superior Court to seal certain eviction records, to authorize the Superior Court to seal certain eviction records upon motion by a tenant, to provide that a housing provider shall not make an inquiry about, require the prospective tenant to disclose or reveal, or base an adverse action on certain criteria, to require a housing provider to provide written notice to a prospective tenant of the housing provider's basis for taking adverse action against the prospective tenant, to provide the tenant an opportunity to dispute the information forming the basis of the housing provider's adverse action; to amend section 16-1501 of the District of Columbia Official Code to provide that the person aggrieved shall not file a complaint seeking restitution of possession for nonpayment of rent in an amount less than $600; and to declare the Sense of the Council that the Superior Court should raise filing fees for eviction cases to $100.</p>

            <p id="&#xA7;3"><span class="level-num">Sec. 3. </span>Section 16-1501 of the District of Columbia Official Code is amended by adding a new subsection (c) to read as follows:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1">"<span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> The person aggrieved shall not file a complaint seeking restitution of possession  pursuant to this section for nonpayment of rent in an amount less than $600; except, that the person aggrieved may file a complaint to recover the amount owed.".</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;4"><span class="level-num">Sec. 4. </span>Sense of the Council.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;4(a)">(a)</span> In 2018, there were over 30,000 eviction filings in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. These filings represent over 17,000 unique households in the District, most of which were concentrated in Wards 7 and 8.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;4(b)">(b)</span> Just 10 housing providers were responsible for 40% of all eviction filings in the District, and around 50% of all filings in the District were for less than $1,000 in rent owed.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;4(c)">(c)</span> A vast majority of these filings did not result in a judgment against the tenant. The Superior Court has reported 1,600 executed evictions annually from 2014 through 2018.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;4(d)">(d)</span> Even when an eviction filing does not result in a judgment against the tenant, the tenant may experience adverse effects associated with the eviction proceeding itself, and the presence of an eviction filing on the tenant's record.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;4(e)">(e)</span> Currently, the filing fee for an eviction action in the Landlord-Tenant Branch of the Superior Court is only $15. In most larger jurisdictions across the country, filing fees range from $50 to nearly $200. In Virginia, filing fees for eviction cases are anywhere from $120 to nearly $350.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;4(f)">(f)</span> Emerging research is finding that filing fees can deter housing providers from filing frivolous cases in Superior Court. A recent study, published in Housing Studies, found that all else being equal, neighborhoods in states with higher eviction filing fees had fewer serial filings (Housing Studies, Dan Immergluck <em>et al.</em>, (Vol. 35, 2020)).</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;4(g)">(g)</span> It is the sense of the Council that the Superior Court should raise filing fees for eviction cases to $100 so that serial filers seeking small sums of money from their tenants are deterred from using eviction filings as a mechanism to collect rent from their tenants.</p>
