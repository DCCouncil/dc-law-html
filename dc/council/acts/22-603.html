            <p style="text-align: center;">AN ACT</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">To authorize, on a temporary basis, the Mayor to exercise eminent domain to acquire certain property located on or near W Street, N.E., Lots 36 and 41 in Square 3942 and Parcel 0143/107, for the purposes of warehousing and storage.</p>
            <p>BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this act may be cited as the "Warehousing and Storage Eminent Domain Authority Temporary Act of 2018".</p>
            <p class="marginalia">Note <a href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-1311.html">§ 16-1311</a></p>
            <p id="&#xA7;2"><span class="level-num">Sec. 2. </span>Findings.</p>
            <p>The Council finds that:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(1)">(1)</span> The District government has a significant need for warehousing and storage space for equipment, records, property, and supplies maintained by District agencies.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(2)">(2)</span> The District government has a need to properly store and maintain government records, equipment of agencies such as the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Department of Public Works, surplus property held by the Office of Contracting and Procurement, and emergency medical supplies for the Department of Health.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(3)">(3)</span> The District's need for warehousing and storage is near to exceeding the District's current capacity at its owned facilities, and there is a reduction in the supply of, and limited vacancy within, warehouse space available for lease in the District.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(4)">(4)</span> The District has identified a site located on W Street, N.E., east of Brentwood Road, N.E. ("W Street Site") as a strong site for these purposes because the site allows for by-right use as a warehouse and storage facility and the site is large enough to accommodate the warehouse and storage needs of numerous District agencies.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(5)">(5)</span> The W Street Site is currently occupied by a private trash transfer station.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;2(6)">(6)</span> Acquisition of the W Street Site will allow the District to construct and operate a facility or multiple facilities to warehouse and store the equipment, records, property, and supplies of numerous District agencies in a District-owned facility.</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;3"><span class="level-num">Sec. 3. </span>Exercise of eminent domain.</p>
            <p>The Mayor may exercise eminent domain in accordance with the procedures set forth in subchapter II of Chapter 13 of Title 16 of the District of Columbia Official Code to acquire Lots 36 and 41 in Square 3942 and Parcel 0143/107 for warehousing and storage purposes.</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;4"><span class="level-num">Sec. 4. </span>Fiscal impact statement.</p>
            <p>The Council adopts the fiscal impact statement of the Chief Financial Officer as the fiscal impact statement required by section 4a of the General Legislative Procedures Act of 1975, approved October 16, 2006 (120 Stat. 2038; D.C. Official Code § 1-301.47a).</p>
            <p id="&#xA7;5"><span class="level-num">Sec. 5. </span>Effective date.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;5(a)">(a)</span> This act shall take effect following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council to override the veto), a 30-day period of congressional review as provided in section 602(c)(1) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 813; D.C. Official Code § 1-206.02(c)(1)), and publication in the District of Columbia Register.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="&#xA7;5(b)">(b)</span> This act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
