            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(B)</span> Enter into a longer-term repayment plan for the payment of the remaining balance of unpaid rent.</p>

            <p class="text-indent-3">"<span class="level-num" id="">(B)</span> The maximum payment for a security or damage deposit shall be the actual amount of the deposit, which may not exceed more than the cost of one month's unsubsidized rent, as specified by the landlord.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2">"<span class="level-num" id="">(6)</span><span class="level-num" id="">(A)</span> Assistance may be authorized for first month's rent if:</p>

Upon the effective date of rules promulgated pursuant to this act, each superseded portion of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program rules shall be deemed repealed.</p>
