A person shall not be considered a full-time employed juror on any day of jury service in which that person:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Would not have accrued regular wages to be paid by the employer if the employee were not serving as a juror on that day; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Would not have worked more than 1/2 of a shift that extends into another day if the employee were not serving as a juror on that day. Employers with 10 or less employees shall not be required to pay a juror-employee his or her usual compensation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If an employer fails to pay an employee in violation of subsection (c) of this section, the employee may bring a civil action for recovery of wages or salary lost as a result of the violation. If an employee prevails in an action under this subsection, that employee shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees fixed by the court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The Board of Judges of the Superior Court may increase the attendance fee and travel allowance provided by this section and, in such event, shall publish the new fee or allowance.</p>
