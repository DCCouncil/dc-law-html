In any such hearing the certificate shall be prima facie evidence of all the facts stated therein.</p>

If the judge at the hearing is satisfied of the desirability of the custody and delivery of the witness, he may, in lieu of issuing subpoena or summons, order the witness to be forthwith taken into custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting State.
