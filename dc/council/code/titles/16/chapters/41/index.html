If he fails to do so by a day named, the court may remove him from his office or trust and appoint a new trustee or other officer in his stead to complete the duties of his office of trust, and may thereupon, order him to deliver over to his successor all the trust property, including moneys, books, papers, bonds, notes, and evidences of debt, and may compel compliance with the order by attachment.</p>
