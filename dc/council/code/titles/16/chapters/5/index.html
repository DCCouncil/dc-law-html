                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The affidavit shall comply with the following requirements:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> show the grounds of plaintiff’s claim;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> set forth that plaintiff has a just right to recover what is claimed in his complaint;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> where the action is to recover damages for breach of a contract set out, specifically and in detail, the breach complained of and the actual damage resulting therefrom.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The affidavit shall also state one of the following facts with respect to defendant:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> defendant is a foreign corporation or is not a resident of the District, or has been absent therefrom for at least six months;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> he evades the service of ordinary process by concealing himself or temporarily withdrawing himself from the District;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> he has removed or is about to remove some or all of his property from the District, so as to defeat just demands against him;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> he has assigned, conveyed, disposed of, or secreted, or is about to assign, convey, dispose of, or secrete his property with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Before a writ of attachment and garnishment is issued, the plaintiff shall first file in the clerk’s office a bond, executed by himself or his agent, with security to be approved by the clerk, in twice the amount of his claim, conditioned to make good to the defendant all costs and damages which he may sustain by reason of the wrongful suing out of the attachment; except that in any case in which the plaintiff states in his affidavit that the value of specified property to be levied upon is less than the amount of his claim, the court may set the amount of such bond in an amount twice the value of the property being attached, and, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, only the property so specified shall be levied upon; provided, that the United States marshal may, in his discretion, when levying upon such property, have the same appraised by an independent appraiser retained by the marshal at the expense of the plaintiff. Any such appraisal shall be made at the time the marshal levies upon the property, and the appraiser shall accompany him for such purpose. If such appraisal has been made, then only such property as may have a value not exceeding one-half of the amount of the bond shall be attached. In the event the appraised value of the property shall be more than one-half of the amount of the bond, the marshal may refuse to execute the writ unless and until the amount of the bond is increased so as to be at least twice the value of the property to be attached.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> If the plaintiff files an affidavit and bond as provided by this section, the clerk shall issue a writ of attachment and garnishment, to be levied upon as much of the lands, tenements, goods, chattels, and credits of the defendant as may be necessary to satisfy the claim of the plaintiff.</p>

                <p>If the defendant files affidavits traversing the affidavits filed by the plaintiff the court shall determine whether the facts set forth in the plaintiff’s affidavits as ground for issuing the attachment are true, and whether there was just ground for issuing the attachment. When, in the opinion of the court, the proofs do not sustain the affidavit of the plaintiff, his agent, or attorney, the court shall quash the writ of attachment. This issue may be tried by the court or a judge at chambers after three days’ notice. The issue may be tried as well upon oral testimony as upon affidavits. If the court deems it expedient, a jury may be impaneled to try the issue.</p>
