                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> A requirement that a party register the order in another state as a prerequisite to allowing the child to travel to that state;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> With regard to the child’s passport:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A direction that the petitioner place the child’s name in the United States Department of State’s Child Passport Issuance Alert Program;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> An acknowledgment in a record from the relevant foreign consulate or embassy that no passport application has been made, or passport issued, on behalf of the child;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> To the petitioner, proof of registration with the United States Embassy or other United States diplomatic presence in the destination country and with the Central Authority for the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, if that Convention is in effect between the United States and the destination country, unless one of the parties objects; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Upon the petitioner’s request, a requirement that the respondent obtain an order from the relevant foreign country containing terms identical to the child-custody determination issued in the United States.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> In an abduction prevention order, the court may impose conditions on the exercise of custody or visitation that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Limit visitation or require that visitation with the child by the respondent be supervised until the court finds that supervision is no longer necessary and order the respondent to pay the costs of supervision;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Require the respondent to post a bond or provide other security in an amount sufficient to serve as a financial deterrent to abduction, the proceeds of which may be used to pay for the reasonable expenses of recovery of the child, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs if there is an abduction; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Require the respondent to obtain education on the potentially harmful effects to the child from abduction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> To prevent imminent abduction of a child, a court may:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-4604.09.html">16-4604.09</a> or the law of this state other than this subchapter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Direct the use of law enforcement to take any action reasonably necessary to locate the child, obtain return of the child, or enforce a custody determination under this subchapter or the law of this state other than this subchapter; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Grant any other relief allowed under the law of this state other than this subchapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The remedies provided in this subchapter are cumulative and do not affect the availability of other remedies to prevent abduction.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> If a petition under this subchapter contains allegations, and the court finds that there is a credible risk that the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The respondent on a petition under subsection (a) of this section shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> An ex parte warrant under subsection (a) of this section to take physical custody of a child shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongful removal of the child is based;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> State the date and time for the hearing on the petition; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of the court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining the placement of the child after the warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of the National Crime Information Center system and similar state databases to determine if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The petition and warrant shall be served on the respondent when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under subsection (a) of this section for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the respondent reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> This subchapter does not affect the availability of relief allowed under the law of this state other than this subchapter.</p>
