The standby guardianship shall be construed so as to enable the designator to plan for the future care of a child, without terminating parental or legal rights, and to give the standby guardian the authority to act in a manner consistent with the known wishes of the designator regarding the care, custody, and support of the minor child.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The facts set forth in the petition; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> A finding that the designator meets the definition of designator as that term is defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-4802.html">16-4802</a>(8).</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The order shall provide that, subject to restoration of the designator’s ability to parent as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-4804.html">16-4804</a>(b), the authority of the standby guardian to act as legal custodian of the child shall be effective upon the Court’s receipt of, or immediately if the Court is in receipt of, one of the following documents:</p>
