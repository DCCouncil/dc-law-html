                <p>The purpose of this subchapter is to create a juvenile justice system capable of dealing with the problem of juvenile delinquency, a system that will treat children as children in all phases of their involvement, while protecting the needs of communities and victims alike. In furtherance of this purpose, the following goals have been established for delinquency cases in the Family Court:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> To provide due process through which juveniles and all other interested parties are assured fair hearings, during which applicable constitutional and other legal rights are recognized and enforced;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To promote youth development and prevent delinquency through early intervention, diversion, and community-based alternatives;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> To preserve and strengthen families whenever possible and to remove a child from the custody of the child’s parents, guardian, or other custodian only when it is determined by the appropriate authority to be in the child’s best interests or when necessary for the safety and protection of the public;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> To hold a child found to be delinquent accountable for his or her actions, taking into consideration the child’s age, education, mental and physical condition, background, and all other relevant factors;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> To place a premium on the rehabilitation of children with the goal of creating productive citizens and to recognize that rehabilitation of children is inextricably connected to the well-being and strength of their families;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> To serve children in their own neighborhood and communities whenever possible;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> To hold the government accountable for the provision of reasonable rehabilitative services;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> To provide for the safety of the public; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> To achieve the foregoing goals in the least restrictive settings necessary, with a preference at all times for the preservation of the family and the integration of parental, guardian, or custodial accountability and participation in treatment and counseling programs.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Petitions initiating judicial action may be signed by any person who has knowledge of the facts alleged or, being informed of them, believes they are true, except that petitions alleging need of supervision may only be signed by the Director of Social Services, a representative of a public agency or a nongovernmental agency licensed and authorized to care for children, a representative of a public or private agency providing social service for families, a school official, or a law enforcement officer. Petitions shall be verified and verification may be upon information or belief.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Each petition shall be prepared by the Corporation Counsel after an inquiry into the facts and a determination of the legal basis for the petition. If the Director of Social Services has refused to recommend the filing of a delinquency petition, or if the Director of the Agency has refused to recommend the filing of a neglect petition, the Corporation Counsel, on request of the complainant, shall review the facts presented and shall prepare and file a petition if he believes such action is necessary to protect the community or the interests of the child. Any decision of the Corporation Counsel on whether to file a petition shall be final.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Where the delinquency petition filed by the Corporation Counsel is the 3rd petition filed against a child and the child is 13 years old or younger, the Child and Family Services Agency shall institute a child neglect investigation against the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> A petition shall be filed by the Corporation Counsel within seven days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays) after the complaint has been referred to the Director of Social Services, except as otherwise provided in section 16-2312. A petition shall set forth plainly and concisely the facts which give the Division jurisdiction of the child under section 11-1101(13). In delinquency cases the petition shall also state the specific statute or ordinance on which the charge is based. If delinquency or need of supervision is alleged, a statement shall be included in the petition that the child appears to be in need of care or rehabilitation. The petition shall contain such other facts and information as may be required by rules of the Superior Court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> A petition may be amended by leave of the Division on motion of the Corporation Counsel or counsel for the child, at any time prior to the conclusion of the factfinding hearing. The Division shall grant the Corporation Counsel, the child, and his parent, guardian, or custodian notice of the amendment and, where necessary, additional time to prepare.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The District of Columbia shall be a party to all proceedings under this subchapter.</p>

Upon motion of the child or the Corporation Counsel, for good cause shown, the hearing may be continued for an additional period not to exceed 30 days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays). If the hearing commences more than 60 days (excluding Sundays and legal holidays) after the filing of the transfer motion, the Division must state in the order the extraordinary circumstances for the delay.</p>

The Division’s findings with respect to each of the factors set forth in subsection (e) of this section relating to the public welfare and protection of the public security shall be included in the statement. The statement shall be available upon request to any court in which the transfer is challenged, but shall not be available to the trier of fact of the criminal charge prior to verdict.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Evidence of the following factors shall be considered in determining whether there are reasonable prospects for rehabilitating a child prior to his majority and whether it is in the interest of the public welfare to transfer for criminal prosecution:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> the child’s age;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> the nature of the present offense and the extent and nature of the child’s prior delinquency record;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> the child’s mental condition;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> the child’s response to past treatment efforts including whether the child has absconded from the legal custody of the Mayor or a juvenile institution;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> the techniques, facilities, and personnel for rehabilitation available to the Division and to the court that would have jurisdiction after transfer; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The potential rehabilitative effect on the child of providing parenting classes or family counseling for one or more members of the child’s family or for the child’s caregiver or guardian.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e-1)</span> For purposes of the transfer hearing the Division shall assume that the child committed the delinquent act alleged.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e-2)</span> There is a rebuttable presumption that a child 15 through 18 years of age who has been charged with any of the following offenses, should be transferred for criminal prosecution in the interest of public welfare and the protection of the public security:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Murder, first degree sexual abuse, burglary in the first degree, robbery while armed, or assault with intent to commit any such offense;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any offense listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection and any other offense properly joinable with such an offense;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Any crime committed with a firearm; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Any offense that if the child were charged as an adult would constitute a violent felony and the child has three or more prior delinquency adjudications.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Prior to a transfer hearing, a study and report, in writing, relevant to the factors in subsection (e), shall be made by the Director of Social Services. This report and all social records that are to be made available to the judge at the transfer hearing shall be made available to counsel for the child and to the Corporation Counsel at least three days prior to the hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> A judge who conducts a hearing pursuant to this section shall not, over the objection of the child for whom a motion to transfer was filed, participate in any subsequent factfinding proceedings relating to the offense.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> Transfer of a child for criminal prosecution terminates the jurisdiction of the Division over the child with respect to any subsequent delinquent act; except that jurisdiction of the Division over the child is restored if (1) the criminal prosecution is terminated other than by a plea of guilty, a verdict of guilty, or a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, and (2) at the time of the termination of the criminal prosecution no indictment or information has been filed for criminal prosecution for an offense alleged to have been committed by the child subsequent to transfer.</p>

                <p>The Director of the Department of Human Services and the Director of Social Services shall ensure that each child at risk who is detained, however briefly, pursuant to section 16-2311(a)(2)   or (b)(1) shall be physically separated at all times, except during transportation, from children or other detainees 13 years of age or older, from any child under the age of 13 who has been detained on the ground that there is probable cause to believe the child has committed a crime of violence, as defined in section 23-1331(4)  , or in any other manner deemed to ensure the safety of the child. Neither the Department of Human Services nor the Director of Social Services shall deliver a child under the age of 13 to the custody of the United States Marshals Service. For the purposes of this section, “child at risk” means a child under the age of 13 or any child 13 years of age or older who, because of his or her size or physical stature, is determined to be especially physically or psychologically vulnerable to attacks by other children.</p>

The report shall contain information regarding the child’s progress toward attaining competency, the treatment being provided, and any recommendations regarding changes to the treatment that would be likely to aid in achieving the goal of the order. If the child is hospitalized, the report shall also include a statement indicating whether inpatient hospitalization continues to be the least restrictive setting for providing treatment and services that may render the child competent in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Payment of restitution to a victim under this section has priority over payments of restitution to a third-party payor or to any governmental entity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If the victim has been compensated for the victim’s loss by a third-party payor, the Division may order restitution payments to the third-party payor in the amount that the third-party payor compensated the victim.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Division may order the child to make restitution directly to the victim, governmental entity, or third-party payor after consideration of the age, circumstances, and financial ability of the child to pay.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A judgment of restitution under this section may not exceed:</p>

A hearing under this section may be held as part of a factfinding or disposition hearing for the child. A judgment of restitution against a parent or guardian may not be entered unless the parent or guardian has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present appropriate evidence in the parent or guardian’s behalf.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> In a restitution hearing, a written statement or bill for medical, dental, hospital, funeral, or burial expenses, or repair and replacement of property shall be prima facie evidence that the amount indicated on the written statement or bill represents a fair and reasonable charge for the services or materials provided. The burden of proving that the amount indicated on the written statement or bill is not fair and reasonable shall be on the person challenging the fairness and reasonableness of the amount.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Upon request of the Corporation Counsel or the recipient of a judgment of restitution, the Division may enforce the judgment for restitution under this section in the same manner that a monetary judgment is enforced by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia under Title 15 and applicable court rules.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The Director of Social Services shall be responsible for monitoring the collection and disbursement of restitution payments when the judgment of restitution provides that restitution is to be made in periodic or installment payments.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> A judgment of restitution under this section shall not preclude a civil action to recover damages from the child, parent, or guardian. A civil verdict shall be reduced by the amount paid under the judgment of restitution. A judgment of restitution may be filed under seal in any civil case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If at the restitution hearing the Division finds that a child is financially unable to pay restitution pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Division may order the child to perform community service or some other non-monetary service of equivalent value in lieu thereof. If at the restitution hearing the Division finds that a parent or guardian is financially unable to pay restitution pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Division may order the parent or guardian to perform community service or some other non-monetary service of equivalent value in lieu thereof.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> When entering a restitution order, the court shall include the restitution conditions both in the disposition order and in a separate judgement [sic] of restitution which shall be filed in a special proceedings case. An order requiring an adult to pay a judgment for restitution shall be filed in a special proceedings case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> An order of restitution requiring a parent or guardian, a child, or both to pay restitution constitutes a judgment and lien against all property of the person or persons required to pay for the amount they are obligated to pay under the order and may be recorded in any office for the filing of liens against real or personal property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span> A judgment of restitution may be enforced by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, a victim entitled under the order to receive restitution, a deceased victim’s estate, or any other beneficiary of the judgment in the same manner as a civil judgment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m)</span> A judgment for restitution that is filed in a special proceedings case shall contain the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The amount of the restitution; and</p>

This information shall be kept confidential except by order of the Division:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The full name, address, telephone number, and social security number of the restitution payer or person who is ordered to pay the restitution; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The full name, address, and telephone number of the recipient of the restitution.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(p)</span> All restitution payments shall be paid to the Superior Court. The payer shall receive a receipt for the payment. If the restitution payment is mailed, a receipt will be returned only if the payer encloses a self-addressed stamped envelope.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(q)</span> The court shall disburse the restitution payments to the recipient and make appropriate court records.</p>

            <h2>§ 16–2335.02. Sealing of records on ground of actual innocence.</h2>
            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Notwithstanding section 16-2335, a person who has been arrested for violation of the District of Columbia Official Code or the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, or has been the subject of a petition filed pursuant to section 16-2305 and whose prosecution has been terminated without adjudication may file a motion with the Family Court at any time to seal all of the records of the arrest and related court proceedings on grounds of actual innocence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The burden is on the movant to establish that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The violation for which the person was arrested or petitioned did not occur; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The movant did not commit the offense.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If the motion is filed within 4 years after the prosecution has been terminated, the movant must satisfy the burden described in subsection (b) of this section by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If the motion is filed more than 4 years after the prosecution has been terminated, the movant must satisfy the burden described in subsection (b) of this section by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> In determining such motions, the Family Court may, but is not required to, employ a rebuttable presumption that the movant is not entitled to relief if the court finds that the government has been substantially prejudiced in its ability to respond to the motion by the delay in its filing, unless the movant shows that the motion is based on grounds which the person could not have raised by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances prejudicial to the government occurred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> An acquittal does not establish a presumption that the movant is innocent or entitled to relief pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> A person whose adjudication has been vacated pursuant to section 16-2335.01(g)(2), and whose subsequent prosecution is terminated without adjudication, may file a motion with the Family Court pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> A person who is found to be actually innocent pursuant to this section or section 16-2335.01(g)(3) shall be entitled to the following relief with respect to such count or counts:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The Family Court shall summarize in the order the factual circumstances of the challenged arrest and any post-arrest occurrences it deems relevant, and, if the facts support such a conclusion, shall rule as a matter of law that the movant did not commit the offense for which the movant was arrested or that no offense had been committed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A copy of the order shall be provided to the movant or his or her counsel.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The movant may obtain a copy of the order at any time from the Family Court, upon proper identification, without a showing of need.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> In a case involving co-respondents or co-defendants in which the Family Court orders the movant’s records sealed, the Family Court may order that only those records, or portions thereof, relating solely to the movant be sealed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The Family Court shall order that the movant’s name be redacted to the extent practicable from records that are not sealed. The Family Court may make an in camera inspection of these records in order to make this determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The Family Court need not order the redaction of references to the movant that appear in a transcript of court proceedings involving the co-defendants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> After references to the movant have been redacted as provided for in this paragraph, the Court shall order those records relating to co-defendants returned to the prosecutor or the Clerk of the Superior Court (“Clerk”).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Court shall not order the redaction of the movant’s name from any published opinion of the trial or appellate courts that refer to the movant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The Court shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Order the prosecutor, any relevant law enforcement agency, the Department of Youth Rehabilitative Services, and any other public or private agencies or institutions that provided supervision or treatment, or had custody of the person, if the supervision, treatment, or custody was under an order issued by the Family Court to seal any records that identify the movant as having been arrested, prosecuted, or adjudicated;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Order the prosecutor to arrange for any computerized record of the movant’s arrest, prosecution, or adjudication to be eliminated except for a restricted-access file that would permit the prosecutor and law enforcement agencies to retrieve sealed records if ordered to do so by the Court; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Expressly allow the prosecutor and law enforcement agencies to maintain a publicly available record so long as it is not retrievable by the identification of the movant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The Family Court shall order the prosecutor, any relevant law enforcement agency, the Department of Youth Rehabilitative Services, and any other public or private agencies or institutions that provided supervision or treatment, or had custody of the person, if the supervision, treatment, or custody was under an order issued by the Family Court to file a certification with the Court within 90 days of an order to seal the records that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, all references that identify the movant as having been arrested, prosecuted, or adjudicated have been sealed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The Family Court shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Order the Clerk to collect all Family Court records pertaining to the movant’s arrest, record, or adjudication and cause to be purged any computerized record;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Expressly allow the Clerk to maintain a record so long as the record is not retrievable by the identification of the movant; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Order the Clerk to file under seal all Family Court records retrieved pursuant to this section, together with the certifications filed pursuant to this subsection by the prosecutor, any relevant law enforcement agency, the Department of Youth Rehabilitative Services, and any other public or private agencies or institutions that provided supervision or treatment, or had custody of the person, if the supervision, treatment, or custody was under an order issued by the Family Court, within 7 days after receipt of such records.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The Clerk shall place the records ordered sealed by the Family Court in a special file, appropriately and securely indexed in order to protect its confidentiality. Unless otherwise ordered by the Family Court, the Clerk shall reply in response to inquiries concerning the existence of records which have been sealed pursuant to this chapter that no records are available.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> Once notified, any District agency in possession of a person’s record shall seal, expunge, and otherwise maintain the record so that the record is in compliance with any order issued by the Family Court pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> The effect of relief pursuant to this section shall be to restore the movant, in the contemplation of the law, to the status he or she occupied before being arrested or charged. No person as to whom such relief has been granted shall be held thereafter under any provision of law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or acknowledge his or her arrest, or charge, or trial in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> A motion to seal filed with the Family Court pursuant to this chapter shall state grounds upon which eligibility for sealing is based and facts in support of the person’s claim. It shall be accompanied by a statement of points and authorities in support of the motion, and any appropriate exhibits, affidavits, and supporting documents. A copy of the motion shall be served upon the prosecutor. The prosecutor shall not be required to respond to the motion unless ordered to do so by the Family Court pursuant to subsection (l) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> If it plainly appears from the face of the motion, any accompanying exhibits, affidavits, and documents, and the record of any prior proceedings in the case, that the movant is not eligible for relief or is not entitled to relief, the Family Court may dismiss or deny the motion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span> If the motion is not dismissed or denied after initial review, the Family Court shall order the prosecutor to file a response to the motion. The prosecutor shall file the response within 60 days of the issuance of the order except where the arrest was not presented to the prosecutor for a charging decision, in which case the prosecutor shall file the response within 90 days of the issuance of the order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m)</span> Upon the filing of the prosecutor’s response, the Family Court shall determine whether a hearing is required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(n)</span> If the Family Court determines that a hearing is required, the hearing shall be scheduled promptly.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(o)</span> At the hearing, the movant and the prosecutor may present witnesses and information by proffer or otherwise. Hearsay evidence shall be admissible.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(p)</span> An order dismissing, granting, or denying the motion shall be in writing and include reasons.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(q)</span> The Family Court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same movant regarding the same offenses or arrests unless the previous motion was dismissed or denied without prejudice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(r)</span> An order dismissing, granting, or denying a motion for sealing is a final order for purposes of appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(s)</span> Records sealed pursuant to this section shall be opened only on order of the Family Court upon a showing of compelling need, except that, upon request, the movant shall be entitled to a copy of the sealed records to the extent that such records would have been available to the movant before relief under this section was granted. A request for access to sealed court records may be made ex parte.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(t)</span> Any person, upon making inquiry of the Family Court concerning the existence of records of arrest, court proceedings, or adjudications involving an individual, shall be entitled to rely, for any purpose under the law, upon the clerk’s response that no records are available under subsection (h)(7) of this section with respect to any issue about that person’s knowledge of the individual’s record.</p>

            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> To the extent that appropriated funds are available, the Mayor may make subsidy payments to a permanent guardian, irrespective of the permanent guardian’s state of residence, as needed on behalf of a child with special needs where the permanent guardian has the capability of providing the permanent family relationships needed by such child in all areas except financial, as determined by the Mayor. For the purposes of this section a “child with special needs” includes any child who is difficult to place in adoption because of age, race, ethnic background, physical or mental condition, or membership in a sibling group which should be placed together, or a child who, in all likelihood, would go without another permanent placement arrangement except for the acceptance of the child as a member of the permanent guardian’s family.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> For a permanent guardian to be eligible for subsidy payments under this section:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The child must be adjudicated neglected pursuant to section 16-2317;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The child must be committed to the legal custody of the Child and Family Services Agency;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Repealed; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A subsidy payment agreement must be entered into by the Child and Family Services Agency and the permanent guardian.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Subsidy payments allowed under this section may be paid, subject to the availability of appropriated funds necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, on a long-term basis to help a permanent guardian whose income is limited and likely to remain so, or on a time-limited basis to help a permanent guardian meet the cost of integrating a child into the family over a specified period of time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, eligibility for subsidy payments under this section may continue during the period of the guardianship order until the child reaches 18 years of age.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> For guardianships that are finalized on or after May 7, 2010, eligibility for subsidy payments under this section shall continue during the period of the guardianship order until the child reaches 21 years of age.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> No subsidy payment to a permanent guardian shall be made on behalf of any child with respect to whom a guardianship order has been entered by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, pursuant to this subchapter, before October 1, 2000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Once during each calendar year and at other times during the year when changed conditions and costs are deemed by the Mayor to warrant review, the Mayor shall review the need for continuing each permanent guardianship subsidy. A permanent guardian who is subject to a subsidy agreement under this section may request, in writing, at any time, for reasons set forth in the request, a review of the amount of the payment or the level of continuing payments. Such review shall begin not later than 30 days from the receipt of the request by the Mayor. At the time of a review, appropriate adjustments in payment shall be made based upon changes in the needs of the child. Any adjustment may be made retroactive to the date a request for review was received by the Mayor. If a request for review is not acted on within 30 days after it has been received by the Mayor, or if the Mayor modifies or terminates an agreement without the concurrence of all parties, any party to the agreement shall be entitled to a hearing under the applicable provisions of subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The Mayor shall disseminate information to prospective permanent guardians as to eligibility for subsidy under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The Mayor shall keep such records as are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of permanent guardianship subsidies as a means of encouraging and promoting the placement of children with special needs with permanent guardians. The Mayor shall make an annual progress report which shall be open to public inspection. The report shall include the number of children placed with permanent guardians under subsidy payment agreements during the year preceding the annual report and the major characteristics of the children placed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Permanent guardianship subsidies shall be subject to the availability of appropriations. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create an entitlement to a permanent guardianship subsidy for any person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The Mayor, pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2, may issues rules to implement the provisions of this section.</p>
