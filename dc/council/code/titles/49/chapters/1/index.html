                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p>No officer or soldier of the National Guard, when ordered on duty to aid the civil authorities, or when ordered into the service of the United States in obedience to the call or order of the President, shall be excused from such duty except upon the certificate of the surgeon of his command of physical disability, such certificate to be presented to the Commanding General in case of an officer, or to his company commander in case of a soldier. If such officer or soldier fail to furnish such excuse he shall be tried and punished by a court-martial. For absence from any other military duty required or ordered under the provisions of this chapter the penalty shall be such as may be prescribed by the Commanding General, or the bylaws of the organization to which the officer or soldier belongs.</p>
