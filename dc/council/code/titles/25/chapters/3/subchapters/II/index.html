                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The establishment is a full service grocery store which is newly constructed with a certificate of occupancy issued after January 1, 2000, or is an existing store which has undergone renovations in excess of $500,000 (i) after January 1, 2000 and prior to [March 8, 2006], or (ii) during the preceding 12 months in which an application is made;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> The opinion of the ANC in which the establishment is located has been given great weight as specified in Chapter 4 [of this title]; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> The applicant does not hold a manufacturer’s or wholesaler’s license.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The 400-foot restriction shall not apply where the main entrance to the college, university, or recreation area, or the nearest property line of the school is actually on or occupies ground zoned commercial or industrial according to the official atlases of the Zoning Commission of the District of Columbia.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> In the case of applications for nightclub or tavern licenses, the Board shall consider whether the proximity of the establishment to a residence district, as identified in the zoning regulations of the District and shown in the official atlases of the Zoning Commission for the District, would generate a substantial adverse impact on the residents of the District.</p>
