                <p>“(a) The Director shall establish a voluntary shared work unemployment compensation program as provided by this section. The Director may adopt rules and establish procedures necessary to administer the shared work unemployment compensation program.</p>

The employer shall report the changes made to the shared work plan in writing to the Director before implementing the changes. If the original shared work plan is substantially modified, the Director shall reevaluate the shared work plan and may approve the modified shared work plan if it meets the requirements for approval under subsection (c) of this section. The approval of a modified shared work plan shall not affect the expiration date originally set for that shared work plan.

                <p>“(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the employment security law, an individual shall be unemployed and eligible for shared work benefits in any week in which the individual, as an employee in an affected unit, works for less than the individual’s normal weekly hours of work in accordance with an approved shared work plan in effect for that week.

                <p>“(4) The individual’s normal weekly hours of work and wages have been reduced as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection for a waiting period of one week which occurs within the period the shared work plan is in effect, which period includes the week for which the individual is claiming shared work benefits.</p>
                <p>“(k) The Director shall pay an individual who is eligible for shared work benefits under this section a weekly shared work benefit amount equal to the individual’s regular weekly benefit amount for a period of total unemployment multiplied by the nearest full percentage of reduction of the individual’s hours as set forth in the employer’s shared work plan. If the shared benefit amount is not a multiple of $1, the Director shall reduce the amount to the next lowest multiple of $1. All shared work benefits under this section shall be payable from the fund.</p>
                <p>“(l) The Director shall not pay an individual shared work benefits for any week in which the individual performs paid work for the participating employer in excess of the reduced hours established under the shared work plan.</p>
                <p>“(m) An individual who has received all of the shared work benefits and regular unemployment compensation benefits available in a benefit year is an exhaustee under section 8(g)(1)(H) of the District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Act, approved August 28, 1935 (49 Stat. 949; D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-107.html">51-107</a>(g)(1)(H)), and shall be entitled to receive extended benefits under such statutes if the individual is otherwise eligible under such statutes.</p>
                <p>“(n) The Director may terminate a shared work plan for good cause if the Director determines that the shared work plan is not being executed according to the terms and intent of the shared work unemployment compensation program.</p>
                <p>“(o) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, an individual shall not be eligible to receive shared work benefits for more than 50 calendar weeks during the 12-month period of the shared work plan; provided, that 2 weeks of additional benefits shall be payable to claimants who exhaust regular benefits and any benefits under any other federal or state extended benefits program. No week shall be counted as a week for which an individual is eligible for shared work benefits for the purposes of this section unless the week occurs within the 12-month period of the shared work plan.”</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> With respect to employment during the calendar year 1936, the rate shall be 1%;</p>

Each year the Director shall credit to each of such accounts having a positive reserve on the computation date, the interest earned from the federal government in the following manner: Each year the ratio of the credit balance in each individual account to the total of all the credit balances in all employer accounts shall be computed as of such computation date, and an amount equal to the interest credited to the District’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States for the 4 most recently completed calendar quarters shall be credited prior to the next computation date on the pro rata basis to all employers’ accounts having a credit balance on the computation date. Such amount shall be prorated to the individual accounts in the same ratio that the credit balance in each individual account bears to the total of the credit balances in all such accounts. In computing the amount to be credited to the account of an employer as a result of interest earned by funds on deposit in the Unemployment Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States to the account of the District, any voluntary contribution made by an employer after June 30th of any year shall not be considered a part of the account balance of the employer until the next computation date occurring after such voluntary contribution was made.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The Director shall for any uncompleted portion of the calendar year beginning July 1, 1943, and for each calendar year thereafter classify employers in accordance with their actual experience in the payment of contributions and with respect to benefits charged against their accounts, except as provided in subsection (c)(3) of this section. Each employer’s contribution rate for each subsequent year or part thereof shall be calculated on the basis of his records filed with the Director and benefit payments disbursed through the applicable computation date. The Director shall compute rates for the second 6 months of 1963 for all employers first acquiring the necessary 12 months’ benefit experience under subsection (c)(4)(A) of this section on the computation date June 30, 1963. Such rates shall be based upon such employer’s experience in the payment of contributions and benefits charged against his account through June 30, 1963, prior to the crediting of his account with Trust Fund interest. All employers issued a rate for the second 6 months of 1963, under this subsection, shall have a computation date of September 30, 1963, for the calendar year 1964.</p>

Unless such employing unit shall file the report or a correct or sufficient report, as the case may be, within 15 days after the mailing of such notice, the Director shall compute such employing unit’s rate of contribution on the basis of such estimates, and the rates so determined shall be subject to increase, but not to reduction, on the basis of subsequently ascertained information.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> In the event of a transfer of a portion of the assets of a covered employer’s business by any means whatever, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade, such transfer shall be deemed a transfer of business and shall constitute the transferee a successor hereunder, unless the director, on the Director’s own motion or on application of an interested party, finds that all of the following conditions exist:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The transferee has not assumed any of the transferor’s obligations;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The transferee has not continued or resumed transferor’s goodwill;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(III)</span> The transferee has not continued or resumed the business of the transferor, either in the same establishment or elsewhere; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(IV)</span> The transferee has not employed substantially the same employees as those the transferor had employed in connection with the assets transferred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The successor, if not already subject to this section, shall become an “employer” subject hereto on the date of such transfer, and shall accordingly become liable for contributions hereunder from and after said date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The successor shall take over and continue the employer’s account, including its reserve and all other aspects of its experience under this section, in proportion to the payroll assignable to the transferred business as determined for the purposes of this section by the Director. However, his successor shall take over only the reserve actually credited to the account of the transferor or for which the transferor has filed a claim with the Director at the date of transfer. The successor shall be secondarily liable for any amounts owed by the employer to the Fund at the time of such transfer; but such liability shall be proportioned to the extent of the transfer of business and shall not exceed the value of the assets transferred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The benefit chargeability of a successor’s account under subsection (c) of this section, if not accrued before the transfer date, shall begin to accrue on the transfer date in case the transferor’s benefit chargeability was then accruing; or shall begin to accrue on the date otherwise applicable to the successor, or on the date otherwise applicable to the transferor, whichever is earlier, in case the transferor’s benefit chargeability was not accruing on the transfer date. Similarly, benefits from a successor’s account, if not chargeable before the transfer date, shall become chargeable on the transfer date, in case the transferor was then chargeable for benefit payments; or shall become chargeable on the date otherwise applicable to the successor or on the date otherwise applicable to the transferor, whichever is earlier, in case the transferor was chargeable for benefit payments on the transfer date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The account taken over by the successor employer shall remain chargeable with respect to accrued benefit and related rights based on employment in the transferred business, and all such employment shall be deemed employment performed for such employer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, if the successor employer was an employer subject to this subchapter prior to the date of transfer, his rate of contributions the remainder of the calendar year shall be his rate with respect to the period immediately preceding his date of acquisition. If the successor was not an employer prior to the date of transfer, his rate shall be the rate applicable to the transferor or transferors with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of transfer; provided, that there was only 1 transferor or there were only transferors with identical rates; if the transferor rates were not identical, the successor’s rate shall be the highest rate applicable to any of the transferors with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of transfer. The rate of the transferor, if still subject to the chapter, will not be redetermined and shall remain the rate with respect to the period immediately preceding the date of transfer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> For future years, for the purposes of subsection (c) of this section, the Director shall determine the “experience under this section” of the successor employer’s account and of the transferring employer’s account by allocating to the successor employer’s account for each period in question the respective proportions of the transferring employer’s payroll, contributions, and the benefit charges which the Director determines to be properly assignable to the business transferred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> Variations from the standard rates of contributions for each calendar year or part thereof shall be determined as of the applicable computation date in accordance with the following requirements:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> As of the computation date, the total benefits paid after June 30, 1939, then chargeable or charged to any employer’s account, shall be subtracted from the total of all contributions credited to his account with respect to employment since May 31, 1939. The result of this computation shall be known as the employer’s reserve and the employer’s contribution rate for the ensuing calendar year shall be established under Table I, II, III, IV, V, or VI of this subparagraph in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection.</p>

Upon receipt of such application, the Director shall voluntarily adjust such matter or shall grant an opportunity for a fair hearing and promptly notify the employer thereof. All such hearings shall be held before a Contribution Rate Review Committee composed of 3 members who shall be employees of the Director and appointed by the Director.

Each nonprofit organization whose total payments for such year are less than the amount so determined shall be liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. If the total payments exceed the amount so determined for the taxable year, all or a part of the excess may, at the discretion of the Director, be refunded from the Fund or retained in the Fund as part of the payments which may be required for the next taxable year.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The amount due specified in any bill from the Director shall be conclusive on the organization unless, not later than 15 days after the bill was mailed to its last-known address or otherwise delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the Director, setting forth the grounds for such application or appeal. The Director shall promptly review and reconsider the amount due specified in the bill and shall thereafter issue a redetermination in any case in which such application for redetermination has been filed. Any such redetermination shall be conclusive on the organization unless the organization files an appeal as set forth in subsection (c)(10) of this section, setting forth the grounds for the appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> Past due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest and penalties that, pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-104.html">51-104</a>(c), apply to past due contributions.</p>

The Director shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as he deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within 15 days of the date notice of the required adjustment was mailed or otherwise delivered to it.

The Director shall require the organization within 15 days following any deduction from a money deposit under the provisions of this subparagraph to deposit sufficient additional money to make whole the organization’s deposit at the prior level. The Director may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as the result of such review, he determines that an adjustment is necessary, he shall require the organization to make additional deposit within 15 days of written notice of his determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as he no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit, as provided under this paragraph, the Director may terminate such organization’s election to make payments in lieu of contributions and such termination shall continue for not less than the 4-consecutive-calendar-quarter period beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; provided, that the Director may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than 15 days.</p>

Upon approval of the application, the Director shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which it receives the application and shall notify the group’s representative of the effective date of the account. Such account shall remain in effect for not less than 2 years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the Director or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group shall be liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bear to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The Director shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance, and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this paragraph, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this paragraph by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> An employer with a household employee may make a return of and pay the contributions that have accrued with respect to the household employee on an annual basis on April 15th to the Department of Employment Services; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The Director of Department of Employment Services shall prescribe such regulations as the director deems necessary to carry out the purpose of allowing household employer to convert from a quarterly system of payments and filing to annual filing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Employers who employ 250 employees or more in a calendar quarter shall file wage reports by magnetic tape or other machine readable method approved by the Director. Employers subject to this provision who fail to file wage reports using magnetic tape or other approved method shall be deemed to have failed to file a timely contribution report and shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of subsection (c) of this section until such time as the report is filed using magnetic tape or other approved method.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the contributions or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h) are not paid when due, there shall be added thereto interest at the rate of 1 1/2 % per month or fraction thereof from the date they become due until paid. Interest shall not run against a court-appointed fiduciary when the contributions or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h) are not paid timely because of a court order.</p>

The penalty shall not be less than $100 and for good cause the penalty may be waived by the Director of the Department of Employment Services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> In the event of the death, dissolution, insolvency, receivership, bankruptcy, composition, or assignment for benefit of creditors of any employer, contributions, or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h), then or thereafter due from such employer under this section shall have priority over all other claims, except taxes due the United States or the District, and wages (not exceeding $600 with respect to any individual) due for services performed within the 3 months preceding such event.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If any employer liable to pay the contribution, or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h), imposed by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a> neglects and refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest) shall be a lien upon all of the property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person. Such lien shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the Director with the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia. The Director may cause a civil action to be filed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to enforce the aforesaid lien by sale of any property or rights to property, whether real or personal, of the delinquent employer affected by said lien. All persons having liens upon or claiming any interest in the property or rights to property sought to be sold, as aforesaid, shall be made parties to the proceedings and brought into court. The Court shall proceed to adjudicate all matters involved therein and finally determine the merits of all claims to a lien upon the property and rights to the property in question, and in all cases where a claim or interest of the Director therein is established, may decree a sale of such property and rights of property by the proper officer of the Court, and any sale made pursuant to such proceedings shall be made subject to any and all valid liens existing against said property or rights to property, at the date of filing of the notice of lien. Such action shall be heard by the Court at the earliest possible date, and shall be entitled to preference on the calendar of the Court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review of this subchapter. In any suit to enforce a lien hereunder the owner of the property or rights of property affected by said lien may be allowed to file with the clerk of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia a written undertaking with 2 or more sureties to be approved by the Court, or with corporate surety approved by the Court, to the effect that he and they will pay the judgment that may be recovered and costs which judgment shall be rendered against all the persons so undertaking. Upon the approval of said undertaking the property or rights of property shall be released from such lien. No such undertaking shall be approved by the Court until the owner of the property or rights of property in question shall have given at least 2 days’ notice to the Director of his intention to apply to the Courts therefor. Each notice shall give the names and residences of the persons intended to be offered as sureties and the time when the motion for such approval will be made, and such sureties shall make oath if required that they are worth over and above all debts and liabilities double the amount of said lien. The Director may appear and object to such approval. When corporate surety is offered and the undertaking bears a certificate of the Clerk of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that said corporation holds authority from the Secretary of the Treasury to do business in the District of Columbia and has a process agent therein, no notice shall be required. Such an undertaking as above mentioned may be offered before any suit is brought in order to discharge the property from such lien, in which case notice shall be given as aforesaid to the Director and the same proceedings shall be had as above directed in relation to the undertaking to be given after the commencement of the suit, except that when the surety is a corporation of the Clerk of said Superior Court of the District of Columbia that said corporation holds authority from the Secretary of the Treasury to do business in the District of Columbia, and has a process agent therein, no notice shall be required; and said undertaking shall be to the effect that the owner of said property or rights of property and his said sureties will pay any judgment that may be rendered in any suit that may thereafter be brought for the enforcement of said lien. If such undertaking be approved before any suit is brought, the surety or sureties may be made parties to such suit; if the undertaking be approved after suit is brought, the surety or sureties shall ipso facto become parties to the suit, and in either case the decree of the Court shall be against the surety or sureties as well as the owner. Subject to such regulations as the Council of the District of Columbia may prescribe, the Director shall issue a certificate of release of the lien if the Director finds that the liability for the amount of the contribution, or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h), imposed, together with all interest in respect thereof, has been satisfied or for any other reason deemed proper by the Director. Such lien shall continue to be valid for a period of 10 years from the date of filing of the notice thereof with the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia, unless the same shall have been released of record, as hereinbefore provided. The foregoing remedy of the Director shall be cumulative and no action taken by the Director shall be or be construed to be an election on the part of the Director to pursue any remedy hereunder to the exclusion of any other remedy for which provision is made in this subchapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Whenever any employing unit contracts with or has under it any contractor or subcontractor for any employment which is a part of its usual trade, occupation, profession, or business, said employing unit shall report to the Director, in accordance with applicable regulations, the name and address of each and every such contractor or subcontractor so employed. Unless such report is made the employing unit shall for all purposes of the chapter be deemed to employ each individual in the employ of each such contractor or subcontractor for each day during which such individual is engaged solely in performing such employment. Any employing unit who thus becomes liable for and pays contributions with respect to individuals in the employ of any such contractor or subcontractor, however, may recover same from such contractor or subcontractor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> In payment of any contribution, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to $.01.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> If, after due notice, any employer defaults in any payment of contributions or interest thereon, the amount due may be collected by the Director or Director’s designated agent in the manner provided by law for the collection of taxes due the District on personal property in force at the time of such collection (including collection thereof by distraint), or by civil action in the name of the Director, and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the costs of such action. Civil actions brought under this section to collect contributions or interest or penalty thereon from an employer shall be heard by the Court at the earliest possible date and shall be entitled to preference upon the calendar of the Court over all other civil actions except petitions for judicial review of this subchapter. This subsection shall not be construed to mean that the Director shall be required to use only this means of collecting delinquent contributions but the Director may use any other legal method which the Director deems advisable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If, not later than 3 years after the date on which any contributions (or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h)) or interest thereon were paid, an employing unit which has paid such contributions (or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h)) or interest thereon shall make application for an adjustment thereof in connection with subsequent contribution with subsequent contribution payments (or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h)) or for a refund thereof because such adjustment cannot be made, and the Director shall determine that such contributions (or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h)) or interest on any portion thereof was erroneously collected, the Director shall allow such employing unit to make an adjustment thereof, without interest, in connection with subsequent contribution payments (or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h)) by it, or if such adjustment cannot be made the Director shall refund said amount, without interest, from the Clearing Account or Benefit Account upon checks issued by the Director or the Director’s duly authorized agent. For like cause and within the same period, adjustment or refund may be so made on the Director’s own initiative. Should benefits have been paid based upon work records filed by the employing unit, claiming an adjustment or refund, such benefit should be disregarded for purposes of figuring such adjustment or refund, and any such benefit payments already having been made at the time of the adjustment or refund, based upon records filed with this Director by such employing unit, shall to that extent be allowed and shall not be deemed to have been paid erroneously.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The Director in the Director’s discretion, whenever the Director may deem it administratively advisable, may charge off of the Director’s books any unpaid account due the Director or any credit due an employer who has been out of business for a period of more than 3 years. Whenever an account is charged off by the Director, there shall be placed in the records of the Director a reason for such action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia, or the executive officer provided for under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-115.html">51-115</a>(b), with the consent of the Council, may prescribe the extent, if any, to which any ruling, regulation, or decision relating to this subchapter shall be applied without retroactive effect.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Director may compromise any civil case arising under this subchapter. Whenever a compromise is made by the Director in each such case, there shall be placed in the records of the Director the opinion of an attorney of the Director with the reasons therefor, including a statement of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The amount of the contributions, or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h), due;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The amount of interest due on the same; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a special escrow account into which the Director shall deposit all funds received in connection with an offer of compromise. Such funds shall be kept in such escrow account until final action is had upon the offer of compromise and shall not be subject to offset for any indebtedness whatsoever. In the event the compromise is approved, the funds shall be transferred to the District Unemployed Compensation Funds. In the event the compromise is disapproved, the funds shall be immediately returned to the individual who made the offer of compromise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If any employer liable to pay contributions or payments in lieu of contributions under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-103.html">51-103</a>(h) files a wage report for the purposes of determining the amount of contributions due under this subchapter but fails to pay contributions, interest, or penalties, the Director may assess the amount of contributions, interest, or penalties due on the basis of the information submitted and shall give written notice of such assessment to the employer. In the event such report is subsequently found to be incorrect additional assessments may be made, notwithstanding paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>

              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> On and after January 1, 1938, benefits shall become payable from the Benefit Account of the District Unemployment Fund. All benefits shall be paid through employment offices.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An individual’s “weekly benefit amount” shall be an amount equal to one twenty-sixth (computed to the next higher multiple of $1) of his total wages for insured work paid during that quarter of his base period in which such total wages were highest, with such other following limitations. The Director shall determine annually a maximum weekly benefit amount by computing 66 2/3% of the average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work, and shall on or before January 1st of the calendar year in which it shall be effective announce by publication in at least 1 newspaper of general circulation in the District, the maximum weekly benefit amount so determined. Such computation shall be made by determining total wages reported as paid for insured work by employers in each 12-month period ending June 30th and dividing said total wages by a figure resulting from 52 times the average of mid-month employment reported by employers for the same period. For the period from March 30, 1962, to December 31, 1962, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be determined and announced by the Director in accordance with the foregoing formula on the basis of wages and employment in the 12-month period ending June 30, 1961. The maximum weekly benefit amount so determined and announced for a calendar year shall apply only to those claims filed in that year qualifying for maximum payment under the foregoing formula. All claims qualifying for payment at the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be paid at the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect when the benefit year to which the claim relates was first established, notwithstanding a change in said amount for a subsequent calendar year. If the maximum weekly benefit amount is not a multiple of $1, then said maximum weekly benefit amount shall be computed to the next multiple of $1.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Effective January 1, 1986, through December 31, 1987, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be $250.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Effective January 1, 1988, and for each calendar year thereafter, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be determined by the Director of the Department of Employment Services (“Director”) by computing 50% of the average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work, unless the Director certifies to the Council on or before September 30th of the preceding year that the financial condition of the District Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund would be worsened by adoption and implementation of a maximum weekly benefit amount determined by that method. Any such certification by the Director shall be accompanied by a recommended maximum weekly benefit amount which shall not be less than the maximum weekly benefit amount then in effect and which shall become the maximum weekly benefit amount for the next calendar year, unless the Council passes a resolution disapproving the Director’s recommendation within 45 days after its receipt.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> For benefit years commencing on or after January 5, 1997, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be $309.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> For benefit years commencing on or after April 12, 2005, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be $359.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> If the Council passes a resolution of disapproval the maximum weekly benefit amount then in effect shall continue in effect for the next calendar year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Each year the Director shall, on or before January 1st of the calendar year in which it shall be effective, announce by publication in at least 1 newspaper of general circulation in the District, the maximum weekly benefit amount.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The computation of the average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work shall be made by determining total wages reported as paid for insured work by employers in each 12-month period ending March 31st and dividing said total wages by a figure resulting from 52 times the average of mid-month employment reported by employers for the same period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> The maximum weekly benefit amount, however determined, announced for a calendar year shall apply only to those claims filed in that year qualifying for the maximum weekly benefit amount. All claims qualifying for payment at the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be paid at the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect when the benefit year to which the claim relates was first established, notwithstanding a change in the maximum amount for any subsequent calendar year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> If the maximum weekly benefit amount, however computed, is not a multiple of $1, then it shall be rounded down to the next lower multiple of $1.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> To qualify for benefits an individual must have:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Been paid wages for employment of not less than $1300 in 1 quarter in his base period;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Been paid wages for employment of not less than $1950 in not less than 2 quarters in such period; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Received during such period wages the total amount of which is equal to at least one and one-half times the amount of his wages actually received in the quarter in such period in which his wages were the highest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If a claimant satisfies the above except that he received wages over the amount necessary to become eligible for maximum benefits, in the quarter in which his wages were the highest, then the additional wages received in such quarter shall not be considered in determining eligibility. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, any otherwise qualified individual, the total amount of whose wages during such period is less than the amount required to have been received during such period under such paragraph, may qualify for benefits, if the difference between the amounts so required to have been received and the total amount of his wages during such period does not exceed $70, but the amount of his weekly benefit, as computed under subsection (b) of this section, shall be reduced by $1 if such difference does not exceed $35, or by $2 if such difference is more than $35. Wages received by an individual in the period intervening between the end of his last base period and the beginning of his last benefit year shall not be available for benefit purposes in a subsequent benefit year unless he has, subsequent to the commencement of such last benefit year, performed services for which he received wages for employment as defined in this subchapter, in an amount equal to at least 10 times the weekly benefit amount for which he qualifies in such last benefit year. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by any amount received or applied for with respect to such week as a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided, or contributed to, by any base period employer; except that no reduction shall be made under this sentence for any amount received under title II of the Social Security Act. For benefit years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, benefits payable to an individual who applied for or is receiving a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided or contributed to by any base period employer shall, under duly prescribed regulations, be reduced (but not below zero) by the prorated weekly amount of such retirement pension or annuity which is reasonably attributable to such week, provided that the claimant has not made contributions to the pension or annuity. An amount received with respect to a period other than a week shall be prorated by weeks. When an individual’s weekly benefit amount is reduced by a pension, the individual’s maximum weekly benefit amount shall be deducted from his total amount of benefits determined pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by the amount of wages received in lieu of notice of dismissal, defined as dismissal payments that the employer is not legally required to make.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Any otherwise eligible individual shall be entitled during any benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to 26 times his weekly benefit amount or 50% of the wages for employment paid to such individual by employers during his base period whichever is the lesser; provided, that the maximum duration of benefits determined on any initial claim made prior to March 15, 1983, shall continue to be 34 weeks during the benefit year to which the initial claim relates. Such total amount of benefits, if not a multiple of $1, shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Any individual who is unemployed in any week as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-101.html">51-101</a>(5) and who meets the conditions of eligibility for benefits of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-109.html">51-109</a> and is not disqualified under the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-110.html">51-110</a> shall be paid with respect to such week an amount equal to the individual’s weekly benefit amount less any earnings payable to the individual with respect to such week deductible in accordance with the following formula: $20 will be added to the weekly benefit amount; from the resulting sum will be subtracted 80% of any earnings payable to the individual for such week. The resulting benefits, if not a multiple of $1, shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1. In no event shall the amount paid for any week exceed the individual’s established weekly benefit amount.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> In addition to the benefits payable under the foregoing subsections of this section, each eligible individual who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to such week $5 for each dependent relative, but not more than $20 shall be paid to an individual as dependent’s allowance with respect to any 1 week of unemployment nor shall any weekly benefit which includes a dependent’s allowance be paid in the amount of more than the established maximum benefit amount. An individual’s number of dependents shall be determined as of the day with respect to which he first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year, and shall be fixed for the duration of such benefit year. The dependent’s allowance is not to be taken into consideration in calculating the claimant’s total amount of benefits in subsection (d) of this section; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to claims for benefit years commencing on or after January 5, 1997.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f-1)</span> For claims for benefit years commencing after August 9, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, in addition to benefits payable under subsections (a) through (e) of this section, each eligible individual who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to that week $15 for each dependent relative, but no more than $50 or 1/2 of the individual’s weekly benefit amount, whichever is less, with respect to any 1 week of unemployment. The amount of the dependent’s allowance paid to an individual shall not be charged to the individual account of an employer. The number of dependents of an individual shall be determined as of the day with respect to which the individual first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year and shall remain fixed for the duration of the benefit year. The dependent’s allowance shall not be taken into consideration in the total amount of benefits calculated pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, this subsection provides a program of extended benefits on and after January 1, 1972.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> As used in this subsection, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> “Extended benefit period” means a period which:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Begins with the third week after a week in which a state “on” indicator occurs; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Ends with either of the following weeks, whichever occurs later:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The third week after the first week for which there is a state “off ” indicator; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The 13th consecutive week of such period; provided, that no extended benefit period may begin by reason of a state “on” indicator before the 14th week following the end of a prior extended benefit period which was in effect with respect to the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> For weeks commencing after September 25, 1982, there is a state “on” indicator for the District for a week if the rate of insured unemployment under this subchapter for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Equaled or exceeded 120% of the average of such rates for the corresponding 13-week period ending in each of the preceding 2 calendar years; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Equaled or exceeded 5%; provided, that with respect to benefits for weeks of unemployment beginning on September 26, 1982, the determination of whether there is a state “on” or “off ” indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> This subparagraph did not contain sub-subparagraph (i) thereof; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The figure “5” contained in sub-subparagraph (ii) thereof was “6”: except, that notwithstanding any such provision of this subsection any week for which there would otherwise be a state “on” indicator shall continue to be such a week and shall not be determined to be a week for which there is a state “off ” indicator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> There is a state “off ” indicator for the District for a week if, for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks, either sub-subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph was not satisfied.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> “Rate of insured unemployment”, for purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, means the percentage derived by dividing: (i) the average weekly number of individuals filing claims for regular benefits in the District for weeks of unemployment with respect to the most recent 13-consecutive-week period as determined on the basis of reports to the Secretary of Labor, by (ii) the average monthly employment covered under this subchapter for the first 4 of the most recent 6 completed calendar quarters ending before the end of such 13-week period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> “Regular benefits” means benefits payable to an individual under this subchapter or under any state law (including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemen pursuant to Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) other than extended benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> “Extended benefits” means benefits (including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemen pursuant to Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) payable to an individual under the provisions of this subsection for weeks of unemployment in his eligibility period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> “Eligibility period” of an individual means the period consisting of the weeks in his benefit year which begin in an extended benefit period and, if his benefit year ends within the extended period, any weeks thereafter which begin in a period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(H)</span> “Exhaustee” means an individual who, with respect to any week of unemployment in his eligibility period:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Has received, prior to such a week, all of the regular benefits that were available to him under this subchapter or any state law (including dependents’ allowances and benefits payable to federal civilian employees and ex-servicemen under Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) in his current benefit year that includes such a week; provided, that for the purposes of this subparagraph, an individual shall be deemed to have received all of the regular benefits that were available to him although as a result of a pending appeal with respect to wages that were not considered in the original monetary determination in his benefits year, he may subsequently be determined to be entitled to added regular benefits; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> His benefit year having expired prior to such a week, has no, or insufficient wages on the basis of which he established a new benefit year that would include such a week; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span><span class="level-num">(I)</span> Has no right to unemployment benefits or allowances, as the case may be, under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965, and such other federal laws as are specified in regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> Has not received and is not seeking unemployment benefits under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; but if he is seeking such benefits and the appropriate agency finally determines that he is not entitled to benefits under such law he is considered an exhaustee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> “State law” means the unemployment insurance law of any state, approved by the Secretary of Labor under § 3304 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(J)</span> The provisions of subparagraphs (A)-(G) of this paragraph shall not apply to any time these provisions are suspended temporarily or permanently by federal law. If these provisions are suspended by federal law, the provisions of this subchapter which apply to claims for and the payment of regular benefits shall apply to claims for and the payment of extended benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(K)</span><span class="level-num">(i)</span> For weeks of unemployment commencing March 15, 2009, there is a state “on” indicator if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The average rate of total unemployment (seasonally adjusted), as determined by the United States Secretary of Labor, for the period consisting of the 3 most recent months for which data for all states are published before the close of any such week equals or exceeds 6.5%; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The average rate of total unemployment in the District (seasonally adjusted), as determined by the United States Secretary of Labor, for the 3 months referred to in sub-sub-subparagraph (I) of this sub-subparagraph equals or exceeds 110% of such average rate for either of the corresponding 3-month periods ending in the 2 preceding calendar years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> There is a state “off” indicator pursuant to this subparagraph for weeks of unemployment commencing December 6, 2009, or such other week as the Congress may specify in any subsequent amendment to section 2005 of the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act of 2009, approved February 17, 2009 (Pub. L. No. 111-5; 123 Stat. 436).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(L)</span><span class="level-num">(i)</span> For weeks of unemployment commencing March 15, 2009, there is a state high unemployment period “on” indicator if the total unemployment insurance rate as established in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph equals or exceeds 8%.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5(A) of this subsection, the total unemployment extended benefit amount payable to any individual pursuant to this subparagraph shall be the least of the following amounts:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> Eighty percent of the total amount of regular benefits (including any applicable dependents’ allowance) that were payable to the individual under this subchapter in the individual’s applicable benefit year;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> Twenty times the individual’s weekly benefit amount (including any applicable dependents’ allowance) which was payable to the individual under this subchapter for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(III)</span> Forty-six times the individual’s weekly benefit amount (including any applicable dependents allowances) for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year, reduced by the total amount of regular benefits that were paid (or deemed paid) to the individual under this subchapter with respect to the benefit year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> There is a state “off” indicator pursuant to this subparagraph for weeks of unemployment commencing December 6, 2009, or such other week as the Congress may specify in any subsequent amendment to section 2005 of the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act of 2009, approved February 17, 2009 (Pub.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Except when the result would be inconsistent with the other provisions of this subsection, the provisions of this subchapter which apply to claims for, or the payment of, regular benefits shall apply to claims for, and the payment of, extended benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> An individual shall be eligible to receive extended benefits with respect to any week of unemployment in his eligibility period only if the Director finds that with respect to such week:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> He is an “exhaustee” as defined in paragraph (1)(H) of this subsection;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> He has satisfied the requirements of this subchapter for the receipt of regular benefits that are applicable to individuals claiming extended benefits, including not being subject to a disqualification for the receipt of benefits; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph, an individual shall not be eligible for extended benefits if his monetary eligibility for regular benefits was based upon the total base period wages that did not exceed his highest quarterly wages by at least 1 1/2 times.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The weekly extended benefit amount payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment in his eligibility period shall be an amount equal to the weekly basic or augmented benefit amount, whichever is appropriate, payable to him during his applicable benefit year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The total extended benefit amount payable to any eligible individual with respect to his applicable year shall be the least of the following amounts:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Thirteen times his weekly benefit amount (including dependents’ allowances) which was payable to him under this subchapter for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> Thirty-nine times his weekly benefit amount (including dependents’ allowances) which was payable to him under this subchapter for a week of total unemployment in the applicable benefit year, reduced by the total amount of regular benefits which were paid (or deemed paid) to him under this subchapter with respect to the benefit year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> For purposes of this paragraph, the total regular benefit amount shall be that amount (including dependents’ allowances) provided in the individual’s monetary determination or the amount of regular benefits (including dependents’ allowances) actually received, whichever is the greater.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph, if the benefit year of any individual ends within an extended benefit period, the remaining balance of extended benefits that such an individual would, but for this section, be entitled to receive in that extended benefit period, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning after the end of the benefit year, shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the product of the number of weeks for which the individual received trade readjustment allowances within that benefit year, multiplied by the individual’s weekly benefit amount for extended benefits.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Director may prescribe. Each employer shall post and maintain in places readily accessible to individuals in his service printed statements concerning such regulations or such other matters as the Director may by regulations prescribe. Each employer shall supply such individuals with copies of such printed statements or materials relating to claims for benefits as the Director may by regulation prescribe. Such printed statements or materials shall be supplied by the Director to each employer without cost to him.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Promptly after an individual has filed a claim for benefits, an agent of the Director designated by it for such purpose shall make an initial determination with respect thereto which shall include a determination with respect to whether or not such benefit may be payable, and if payable, the week with respect to which payments will commence, the maximum duration thereof, and the weekly benefit amount, except that in any case in which the payment or denial of benefits will be determined by the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-110.html">51-110</a>(e), the agent shall promptly transmit such claim to an appeal tribunal which shall make a decision thereon after such investigation as it deems necessary, and after affording the parties opportunity for fair hearing in accordance with subsection (e) of this section, and the claimant and interested parties shall be given notice thereof and permitted to appeal therefrom to the Director and the courts as is provided in this subchapter for notice of, and appeals from, decisions of appeal tribunals. An initial determination may, for good cause, be reconsidered. The claimant and other parties to the proceedings shall be promptly notified of the initial determination or any amended determination and the reasons therefor. Benefits shall be denied or, if the claimant is otherwise eligible, paid promptly in accordance with such initial determination except as hereinafter otherwise provided. The Director shall promptly notify the claimant and any party to the proceeding of its determination, and such determination shall be final within 15 calendar days after the mailing of notice thereof to the party’s last-known address or in the absence of such mailing, within 15 calendar days of actual delivery of such notice. The 15-day appeal period may be extended if the claimant or any party to the proceeding shows excusable neglect or good cause. The exception for good cause or excusable neglect shall apply to all claims pending on July 23, 2010, including those in which an appeal has been filed in the Office of Administrative Hearings or in which a petition for review has been filed in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. If an appeal tribunal affirms an initial determination allowing benefits, such benefits shall be paid regardless of any appeal which may thereafter be taken. If, subsequent to such initial determination, benefits with respect to any week for which a claim has been filed are denied for reasons other than matters included in the initial determination, the claimant shall be promptly notified of the denial and the reasons therefor, and may appeal therefrom in accordance with the procedure herein described for appeals from initial determinations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> To hear and decide appealed claims, the Director shall appoint 1 or more appeal tribunals to hold hearings in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Director at which all parties shall be given opportunity to present evidence and to be heard. In the conduct of such hearings, the parties shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence or other technical rules of procedure, but the appeal tribunal shall use due diligence to ascertain the true facts of the case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Each appeal tribunal shall consist of either an examiner regularly employed by the Director on a salaried basis or a body composed of an examiner who shall act as chairman, and, without regard to the civil service laws otherwise applicable, of 1 representative of employees and 1 representative of employers, each designated by the Director. No representative shall be regularly employed by the Director, nor shall any person acting in any case on behalf of the Director have any interest, direct or indirect, in the case. In no case shall the hearings proceed unless the examiner designated as a member of an appeal tribunal is present; and if either or both of such representatives fail to appear for any such hearings or are disqualified from participating in any such hearings, the examiner shall proceed to hear the case; provided, that the Director may designate alternates to serve in the absence or disqualification of any member of an appeal tribunal. Each such representative shall be paid for each day on which he actively engaged or was present and prepared to engage in the conduct of any such hearings, such sums, not in excess of $10, as the Director shall by regulation prescribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> An appeal tribunal, after affording the parties reasonable opportunity for fair hearing, shall, unless such appeal is withdrawn, affirm or modify the finding of facts and the initial determination. The parties shall be duly notified of the decision of such appeal tribunal, together with the reasons therefor. The Director, under regulations prescribed by the Director, may permit further appeal by any party or may, upon the Director’s own motion, affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the appeal tribunal or may set it aside and order a rehearing or the taking of additional evidence before the same or a different appeal tribunal. Unless a petition for such appeal is filed within 10 days of mailing of the decision of an appeal tribunal, or within such 10-day period the Director has taken action on the Director’s own motion in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, the decision of the appeal tribunal shall constitute the decision of the Director and shall be effective as such. Any decision of an appeal tribunal which is not so modified or so appealed within such 10-day period is final for all purposes, except as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-112.html">51-112</a>, and is not subject to review by the Office of the Inspector General. All decisions rendered by the Director affirming, reversing, or modifying any decision of an appeal tribunal shall become effective immediately, unless the Director shall otherwise order, and are not subject to review by the Office of the Inspector General.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with an appealed claim. All testimony at every hearing on any such claim shall be taken down by a stenographer or recording device, but shall not be transcribed except upon order of the Director or in the event of an appeal pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-112.html">51-112</a>. Upon any such appeal, a copy of all the testimony and of the findings of fact upon which the Director’s decision was based shall be filed with the court, and the facts so found shall, if supported by evidence, be binding on the court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> Witnesses subpoenaed pursuant to this section shall be allowed fees at a rate fixed by the Director. Such fees shall be deemed part of the expense of administering this subchapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The Director shall establish and administer a Claimant-Employer Advocacy Fund, funded with monies collected as interest and penalty payments from employers due to their late filing of wage reports, late payment of employer contributions, and late payment of payments in lieu of contributions. The Fund shall be used exclusively to support the provision of assistance to and legal representation for claimants and employers involved in administrative appeals of claim determinations made by the Director. The Fund shall support the provision of such assistance and representation for claimants at the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO and shall support the provision of such assistance and representation for employers at the D.C. Chamber of Commerce and at the Greater Washington Board of Trade.

All such payments of expenses shall be made by checks drawn by the Director and shall be subject to audit by the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the same manner as are payments of other expenses of the District.

Moneys so received shall, immediately upon such receipt, be deposited in the Treasury of the United States in the same special account as are all other moneys received for the administration of this subchapter. All moneys received by the Director pursuant to § 302 of the Social Security Act shall be expended solely for the purposes and in the amounts found necessary by the Department of Labor for the proper and efficient administration of this subchapter. In lieu of incorporation in this subchapter of the provision described in § 303(a)(9) of the Social Security Act, the Mayor shall include in the Mayor’s annual report to Council of the District of Columbia, provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-113.html">51-113</a>, a report of any moneys received after July 1, 1941, from the Department of Labor under title III of the Social Security Act, and any unencumbered balances in the Employment Compensation Administration Fund as of that date, which the Department of Labor finds have, because of any action or contingency, been lost or have been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those found necessary by the Department of Labor for the proper administration of this subchapter.</p>

                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Office of Auditor abolished: The Office of the Auditor of the District of Columbia was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 3 of the Board of Commissioners, dated August 28, 1952, established under the direction and control of the Board of Commissioners, a Department of General Administration headed by a Director. The Order transferred to the Director all of the functions and positions of the Office of the Auditor. Reorganization Order No. 19 established in the Department of General Administration an Internal Audit Office headed by an Internal Audit Officer. The function of post auditing benefit payments made by the District Unemployment Compensation Board referred to in § 46-109 was transferred from the Auditor to the Internal Audit Officer. The functions of auditing all moneys paid to and collected by the District Unemployment Board as provided in subsection (a) of § 46-105, were transferred from the Auditor to the Internal Audit Officer, Department of General Administration by Reorganization Order No. 19. The function of the Auditor of the District concerning the prior audit of refunds under subsection (i) of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-104.html">51-104</a> was transferred from the Auditor to the Accounting Officer, Finance Office, Department of General Administration by Reorganization Order No. 20, dated November 10, 1952. Reorganization Order No. 20 was superseded by Organization Order No. 121, dated December 12, 1957. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. Reorganization Order No. 19 and Organization Order No. 121 were revoked and replaced by Organization Order No. 3, dated December 13, 1967. Parts IVB and IVC of the latter Order established within the newly created Department of General Administration, an Internal Audit Office and a Finance Office and prescribed the functions thereof. These functions were subsequently transferred to the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue by paragraph 4 of Commissioner’s Order No. 69-96, dated March 7, 1969. Functions pertaining to centralized accounting as set forth in Commissioner’s Order No. 69-96 were transferred to the Director of the Office of Budget and Financial Management by Organization Order No. 30, dated April 5, 1972. Part IVB of Organization Order No. 3 and that portion of paragraph 4 of Commissioner’s Order No. 69-96 pertaining to a transfer of audit functions to the Department of Finance and Revenue, were revoked by Organization Order No. 33, dated July 14, 1972. The latter Order established an Office of Municipal Audit and Inspection and prescribed the functions thereof. The Office of Municipal Audit and Inspection was replaced by Mayor’s Order No. 79-7, dated January 2, 1979, which Order established the Office of the Inspector General of the District of Columbia.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
