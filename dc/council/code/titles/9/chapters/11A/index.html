                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> There are over 3,500 bus stops in the District of Columbia;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The District of Columbia Department of Transportation estimates that it would be appropriate to place bus shelters at at least 1,500 of the 3,500 bus stops with advertisements on 750 of the bus shelters;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority currently proposes to install only 366 bus shelters in the District of Columbia;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> It currently costs approximately $2,800 to purchase and install a bus shelter in the District of Columbia (the United States Department of Transportation has been paying 80% of this amount, while the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is responsible for 20%);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> The District of Columbia government does not have the funds to purchase and install the number of bus shelters which are necessary to meet the needs of the bus-riding public in the District of Columbia; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The purposes of this chapter are to:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Gross advertisement receipts shall be defined as payments received by the franchisee, its agents or designees, less commission paid to the advertisement brokerage agencies involved, in connection with the display of advertising material on the bus shelters.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Notwithstanding the above provisions, the franchisee will guarantee to the District of Columbia government a minimum payment of $300 per year per bus shelter for the first 5 years of the franchise agreement and $450 per year per bus shelter for the second 5 years of the franchise agreement. The Mayor may establish the appropriate minimum payment levels to be included in any franchise effective after the 10 year period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> As further security for performance by the franchisee of its obligations, the franchisee shall deposit into an escrow account, every 3 months, beginning 6 months after the effective date of the franchise, a sum equal to 1/10% of its gross revenues until said fund reaches a total of $100,000. This fund shall be maintained at such depositories designated by the Mayor pursuant to the District of Columbia Depository Act of 1977, effective October 26, 1977 (<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/2-32.html">D.C. Law 2-32</a> [repealed]) and shall bear interest to the franchisee. The fund shall be used to reimburse the District of Columbia for any financial loss incurred by reason of a default by the franchisee, or for the cost of moving bus shelters if the franchisee does not move them when required to do so. Upon the expiration of the term or the renewed term, the unobligated sum on deposit shall be returned to the franchisee.</p>
