                <p>The Congress finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The 2 federally owned airports in the metropolitan area of Washington, District of Columbia, constitute an important and growing part of the commerce, transportation, and economic patterns of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the surrounding region;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Baltimore/Washington International Airport, owned and operated by the State of Maryland, is an air transportation facility that provides service to the greater Metropolitan Washington region together with the 2 federally owned airports, and timely federal-aid grants to Baltimore/Washington International Airport will provide additional capacity to meet the growing air traffic needs and to compete with other airports on a fair basis;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The federal government has a continuing but limited interest in the operation of the 2 federally owned airports, which serve the travel and cargo needs of the entire Metropolitan Washington region as well as the District of Columbia as the national seat of government;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Operation of the Metropolitan Washington Airports by an independent local agency will facilitate timely improvements at both airports to meet the growing demand of interstate air transportation occasioned by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> All other major air carrier airports in the United States are operated by public entities at the state, regional, or local level;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Any change in status of the 2 airports must take into account the interest of nearby communities, the traveling public, air carriers, general aviation, airport employees, and other interested groups, as well as the interests of the federal government and state governments involved;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> In recognition of a perceived limited need for a federal role in the management of these airports and the growing local interest, the Secretary has recommended a transfer of authority from the federal to the local/state level that is consistent with the management of major airports elsewhere in the Nation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> An operating authority with representation from local jurisdictions, similar to authorities at all major airports in the United States, will improve communications with local officials and concerned residents regarding noise at the Metropolitan Washington Airports;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> A commission of congressional, state, and local officials and aviation representatives has recommended to the Secretary that transfer of the federally owned airports be as a unit to an independent authority to be created by the Commonwealth of Virginia and the District of Columbia; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> The federal interest in these airports can be provided through a lease mechanism which provides for local control and operation.</p>

              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The Secretary is authorized to enter into a lease of the Metropolitan Washington Airports with the Airports Authority for a 50-year term and to enter into any related agreement necessary for the transfer of authority and property to the Airports Authority. Authority to enter into a lease and agreement under this section shall lapse 2 years after October 30, 1986.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The lease shall provide for the Airports Authority to pay to the general fund of the Treasury annually an amount, computed using the GNP Price Deflator, to equal $3,000,000 in 1987 dollars. The Secretary and the Airports Authority may renegotiate the level of lease payments attributable to inflation costs every 10 years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Not later than 1 year after the lease takes effect, the Airports Authority shall pay to the Treasury of the United States, to be deposited to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management to represent the actual added costs incurred by the Fund due to discontinued service retirement under 5 U.S.C. § 8336(d)(1), of employees who elect not to transfer to the Airports Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Not later than 1 year after the lease takes effect, the Airports Authority shall pay to the Treasury of the United States, to be deposited to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management to represent the present value of the difference between (i) the future cost of benefits payable from the Fund and due the employees covered under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1007.html">9-1007</a>(e) that are attributable to the period of employment following the date the lease takes effect, and (ii) the contributions made by the employees and the Airports Authority under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1007.html">9-1007</a>(e). In determining the amount due, the Office of Personnel Management shall take into consideration the actual interest such amount can be expected to earn when invested in the Treasury of the United States.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Airports Authority shall agree, at a minimum, to the following conditions and requirements in the lease:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Airports Authority shall operate, maintain, protect, promote, and develop the Metropolitan Washington Airports as a unit and as primary airports serving the Metropolitan Washington area.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The real property constituting the Metropolitan Washington Airports shall, during the period of the lease, be used only for airport purposes. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “airport purposes” means a use of property interests (other than a sale) for aviation business or activities, or for activities necessary or appropriate to serve passengers or cargo in air commerce, or for nonprofit, public use facilities. If the Secretary determines that any portion of the real property leased to the Airports Authority pursuant to this chapter is used for other than airport purposes, the Secretary shall (A) direct that appropriate measures be taken by the Airports Authority to bring the use of such portion of real property in conformity with airport purposes, and (B) retake possession of such portion of real property if the Airports Authority fails to bring the use of such portion into a conforming use within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Airports Authority shall be subject to the requirements of 49 U.S.C. § 2210(a) [obsolete; see now 49 U.S.C. § 47107(a)] and the assurances and conditions required of grant recipients under such Act as of the date the lease takes effect. Notwithstanding 49 U.S.C. § 2210(a)(12) [obsolete; see now 49 U.S.C. § 47107(a)], all revenues generated by the Metropolitan Washington Airports shall be expended for the capital and operating costs of such airports.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> In acquiring by contract supplies or services for an amount estimated to be in excess of $200,000, or awarding concession contracts, the Airports Authority shall obtain, to the maximum extent practicable, full and open competition through the use of published competitive procedures. By a vote of 7 members, the Airports Authority may grant exceptions to the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, all regulations of the Metropolitan Washington Airports (14 C.F.R. part 159) shall become regulations of the Airports Authority on the date the lease takes effect and shall remain in effect until modified or revoked by the Airports Authority in accordance with procedures of the Airports Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The following regulations shall cease to be in effect on the date the lease takes effect:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Except as specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Airports Authority shall assume all rights, liabilities, and obligations (tangible and incorporeal, present and executory) of the Metropolitan Washington Airports on the date the lease takes effect, including leases, permits, licenses, contracts, agreements, claims, tariffs, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and litigation relating to such rights and obligations, regardless whether judgment has been entered, damages awarded, or appeal taken. Before the date the lease takes effect, the Secretary shall also assure that the Airports Authority has agreed to cooperate in allowing representatives of the Attorney General and the Secretary adequate access to employees and records when needed for the performance of functions related to the period before the effectiveness of the lease. The Airports Authority shall assume responsibility for the Federal Aviation Administration’s Master Plans for the Metropolitan Washington Airports.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The procedure for disputes resolution contained in any contract entered into on behalf of the United States before the date the lease takes effect shall continue to govern the performance of the contract unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the contract.
