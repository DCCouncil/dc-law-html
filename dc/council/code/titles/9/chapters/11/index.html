                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>To further the objectives of subchapter I of this chapter, the Congress hereby finds and declares that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> A coordinated system of rail rapid transit, bus transportation service, and highways is essential in the National Capital region for the satisfactory movement of people and goods, the alleviation of present and future traffic congestion, the economic welfare and vitality of all parts of the region, the effective performance of the functions of the United States government located within the region, the orderly growth and development of the region, the comfort and convenience of the residents and visitors to the region, and the preservation of the beauty and dignity of the Nation’s Capital;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Such a coordinated system should be developed cooperatively by the federal, state, and local governments of the National Capital region as part of a balanced system of transportation utilizing to their best advantage highways and other transit facilities, and the cost of improved mass transit facilities should be financed, as far as possible, by persons using or benefiting from such facilities and their remaining costs should be shared equitably among the federal, state, and local governments;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Various steps have already been taken to bring such a system into being, including the preparation by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (hereinafter referred to as the “Authority”) of a transit development program for the National Capital region, and authorization of the negotiation by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia of an interstate compact to establish a regional transportation organization under the terms of §§ 1-1408 and 1-1409, and approval by the Congress of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact (§§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1103.01.html">9-1103.01</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1103.02.html">9-1103.02</a>.) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as altering or amending the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> While the negotiation of an interstate compact to establish a regional transportation organization has not been completed, and plans for the development of improved mass transit facilities throughout the National Capital region are still being developed, the Authority has prepared a satisfactory transit development program for the establishment, principally within the District of Columbia, of a system of rail rapid transit lines and related facilities which are capable of being extended to serve other parts of the region, and the design and construction of such facilities should now proceed as contemplated by subchapter I of this chapter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> In developing such improved transportation facilities, it is necessary that the operation of rail rapid transit and bus services be coordinated, and that the creation and operation of public rail rapid transit facilities be accomplished with the least possible adverse effect on the private companies transporting persons in the National Capital region, on their employees, and on persons, families and businesses displaced by the construction of such facilities.</p>

                <p>Sections 1-1408 and  1-1409, referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (3) of this section, were repealed by the Act of December 9, 1969, 83 Stat. 322, Pub. L. 91-143, § 8(a)(1).</p>
                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p>Section 5 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-138.html">D.C. Law 11-138</a> provided that §§ 2, 3, and 4 shall take effect after those provisions have been adopted by the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Virginia in a manner provided by law therefor, and have received the consent of Congress.</p>
                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Although the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland passed legislation amending various portions of the Compact in 1983-1984, Congress did not act upon these changes until 1988. Congressional approval was granted pursuant to H.J. Res. 480, Pub. L. 100-285, April 7, 1988. The Legislative History of H.J. Res. 480, H.R. Rep. 521, 100th Cong., 2d. Sess., explains that “H.J. Res. 480 represents the amendments ratified by each of the three jurisdictions which are substantially similar. . . . [P]rovisions which are not substantially similar are not included in H.J. Res. 480, and are therefore not granted the consent of the Congress.” The version of § 76(e) as passed by the Council was not included in the Resolution because there were discrepancies between the provisions adopted by the District and that adopted by Maryland and Virginia. Since Congress did not enact the amended version of § 76(e), the 1976 version as set out above is still in effect. This version, which was enacted pursuant to Pub. L. 94-306, is contained in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact (1988 ed.) published by WMATA.</p>
                <p>Execution of Compact: The Compact set forth in this section was signed as follows: By the Governor of Maryland, November 17, 1966; by the Governor of Virginia, November 21, 1966; and by the President of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, November 22, 1966.</p>
                <p>Policy of Congress: Section 805 of the Act of December 15, 1971, 85 Stat. 659, Pub. L. 92-196, declared the policy of Congress that, to the extent that costs of the regional transit projects are not covered by the user charges, such costs would be equitably charged among the federal, District of Columbia, and participating local governments.</p>
                <p>Mayor to enter into agreements and effective date: Section 3 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/10-244.html">D.C. Law 10-244</a> provided that the Mayor of the District of Columbia shall, for the District of Columbia, enter into agreements with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland to make technical amendments to Title III of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact, so long as the amended version of the Compact then substantially conforms to the amendments in section 2 of the act. The technical amendments shall become effective when the Mayor executes the agreements concerning the Compact.</p>
                <p>Land for D.C. transportation facilities: Section 1 of Pub. L. 98-340 provided that the Architect of the Capitol and the District of Columbia is directed to enter into an agreement for the conveyance of certain real property, the Secretary of the Interior is directed to permit the District of Columbia and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to construct, maintain, and operate certain transportation improvements on federal property, and the Architect of the Capitol is directed to provide the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority access to certain real property.</p>
                <p>Adoption of amendments subject to Congressional consent: Pursuant to § 2 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-138.html">D.C. Law 11-138</a>, the District of Columbia adopted amendments to Article I of Title I and Articles III, VI, XIII, XIV, and XVI of Title III of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact as set forth in §§ 2 and 3 of the act, subject to the consent of Congress thereto and the fulfillment of the conditions in §§ 5 and 6 of the act.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(425) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
                <h4>Resolutions</h4>
                <p>Resolution 13-682, the “Tri-Jurisdiction Joint Legislative Commission on Interstate Transportation Emergency Resolution of 2000”, was approved effective October 17, 2000.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Whereas, the average length of commute in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area is second only to metropolitan New York, demonstrating the severity of traffic congestion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Whereas, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge was designed to carry 70,000 vehicles per day, but carries an actual load of 160,000 vehicles per day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> Whereas, the volume of traffic in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area is expected to increase by more than 70% between 1990 and 2020.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> Whereas, the deterioration of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge and the growing population in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area account for a large part of traffic congestion, and identifying alternatives to this vital link in the interstate highway system and the Northeast corridor is critical to addressing the area’s traffic congestion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> Whereas, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge is the only drawbridge on the regional interstate network, the only piece of the Capital Beltway with only 6 lanes, and the only segment with a remaining life span of only 10 years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(7)">(7)</span> Whereas, the existing Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge is the only part of the interstate system owned by the federal government, and, while the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia maintain and operate the bridge, no entity has ever been granted full and clear responsibility for all aspects of this facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(8)">(8)</span> Whereas, continued federal government ownership of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge will impede cohesive regional transportation planning as it relates to identifying alternative solutions for resolving problems of the existing Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(9)">(9)</span> Whereas, any change in the status of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge must take into account the interest of nearby communities, the commuting public, and other interested groups, as well as the interest of the federal government and the state and local governments involved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(10)">(10)</span> Whereas, in recognition of a need for a limited federal role in the management of this bridge and the growing local interest, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation has recommended a transfer of authority and ownership from the federal to the local and state level, consistent with the management of other bridges elsewhere in the nation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(11)">(11)</span> Whereas, a commission comprised of congressional, state, and local officials and transportation representatives has recommended transfer of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge to an independent authority to be created by the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(12)">(12)</span> Whereas, a coordinated approach without regard to political and legal jurisdictional boundaries, through the cooperation of the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District of Columbia by and through a common agency similar to other Washington, D.C., area authorities, is a proper and necessary step looking toward the alleviation of traffic problems related to the inadequacy of the existing Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.</p>
