                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

For this purpose, the Transit Authority shall be considered a “local public body” within the meaning of that section and, accordingly, the Secretary may authorize and approve capital grant assistance to the Transit Authority in the maximum amount provided for in the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 toward the cost of acquisition of such bus system or systems, including the cost of improvements to or replacement of acquired equipment and facilities approved by the Secretary in conjunction with such acquisition. Such assistance shall be provided from funds available to the Urban Mass Transportation Administration of the Department of Transportation.</p>
