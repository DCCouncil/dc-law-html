                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Whereas, traffic congestion imposes serious economic burdens in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, costing commuters an estimated $1,000 each per year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Whereas, the average length of commute in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area is second only to metropolitan New York, demonstrating the severity of traffic congestion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Whereas, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge was designed to carry 70,000 vehicles per day, but carries an actual load of 160,000 vehicles per day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Whereas, the volume of traffic in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area is expected to increase by more than 70% between 1990 and 2020.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Whereas, the deterioration of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge and the growing population in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area account for a large part of traffic congestion, and identifying alternatives to this vital link in the interstate highway system and the Northeast corridor is critical to addressing the area’s traffic congestion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Whereas, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge is the only drawbridge on the regional interstate network, the only piece of the Capital Beltway with only 6 lanes, and the only segment with a remaining life span of only 10 years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Whereas, the existing Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge is the only part of the interstate system owned by the federal government, and, while the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia maintain and operate the bridge, no entity has ever been granted full and clear responsibility for all aspects of this facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> Whereas, continued federal government ownership of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge will impede cohesive regional transportation planning as it relates to identifying alternative solutions for resolving problems of the existing Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> Whereas, any change in the status of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge must take into account the interest of nearby communities, the commuting public, and other interested groups, as well as the interest of the federal government and the state and local governments involved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> Whereas, in recognition of a need for a limited federal role in the management of this bridge and the growing local interest, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation has recommended a transfer of authority and ownership from the federal to the local and state level, consistent with the management of other bridges elsewhere in the nation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(11)</span> Whereas, a commission comprised of congressional, state, and local officials and transportation representatives has recommended transfer of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge to an independent authority to be created by the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(12)</span> Whereas, a coordinated approach without regard to political and legal jurisdictional boundaries, through the cooperation of the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the District of Columbia by and through a common agency similar to other Washington, D.C., area authorities, is a proper and necessary step looking toward the alleviation of traffic problems related to the inadequacy of the existing Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.</p>

Such federal funds shall be in addition to, and shall not diminish, the federal transportation funding allocated to the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the State of Maryland.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">29.</span> All counties, cities, towns, and other political subdivisions and all public agencies and authorities of the signatories, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, are hereby authorized and empowered to lease, lend, grant, or convey to the Authority at the Authority’s request, upon such terms and conditions as the proper authorities of such counties, cities, towns, political subdivisions, agencies, or authorities may deem reasonable and fair and without the necessity for any advertisement, order of court or other action or formality, other than the regular and formal action of the authorities concerned, any real property which may be necessary or convenient to the effectuation of the authorized purposes of the Authority, including public roads and other real property already devoted to public use.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">32.</span> Except as provided in sections 33, 34, and 37, and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by federal statute, the Authority, in conducting a procurement of property, services, and construction, shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this section; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement. In determining the competitive procedure appropriate under the circumstances, the Authority shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Solicit sealed bids if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> It is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> There is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">33.</span> The Authority may provide for the procurement of property, services, or construction covered by this article using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources of supply for that property, service, or construction if the Authority determines that excluding the source would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for procurement of property, services, and construction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">34.</span> The Authority may use procedures other than competitive procedures if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The property, services, or construction needed by the Authority are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property, services, or construction will satisfy the needs of the Authority;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Authority’s need for the property, services, or construction is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Authority would be seriously injured unless the Authority limits the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Authority determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The property or services needed can be obtained through federal or other sources at reasonable prices.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">35.</span> For the purposes of applying section 34(a):</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> In the case of a contract for property, services, or construction to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited proposal, the property, services, or construction shall be deemed to be available from only one responsible source if the source has submitted an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a concept:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> That is unique and innovative or, in the case of a service, for which the source demonstrates a unique capability to provide the service; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The substance of which is not otherwise available to the Authority and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> In the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment or the continued provision of highly specialized services, the property, services, or construction may be deemed to be available from only the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures if it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Substantial duplication of cost to the Authority that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Authority’s needs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">36.</span> If the Authority uses procedures other than the competitive procedures to procure property, services, or construction under section 34(b), the Authority shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">37.</span> (a) To promote efficiency and economy in contracting, the Authority may use simplified acquisition procedures for purchases of property, services, or construction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> For the purposes of this section, simplified acquisition procedures may be used for purchases for an amount that does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold adopted by the federal government.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the procedures under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> In using simplified acquisition procedures, the Authority shall promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">38.</span> The Board shall adopt policies and procedures to implement sections 32-37 of this Article. The policies and procedures shall provide for publication of notice of procurements and other actions designed to secure competition where competitive procedures are used.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">39.</span> The Authority, in its discretion, may reject any and all bids or proposals received in response to a solicitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">Article V</span><span class="level-heading"> Incidental Powers</span> </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">40.</span> The Authority shall have power to construct grade separations at intersections of the project with public highways and to change and adjust the lines and grades of such highways so as to accommodate the same to the design of such grade separation. The cost of such grade separations, and any damage incurred in changing and adjusting the lines and grades of such highways, shall be ascertained and paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project. If the Authority shall find it necessary to change the location of any portion of any public highway, it shall cause the same to be reconstructed at such location as the Authority shall deem most favorable and of substantially the same type and in as good condition as the original highway. The cost of such reconstruction and any damage incurred in changing the location of any such highway shall be ascertained and paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">41.</span> Subject to the approval by the highest ranking official of the jurisdiction in which the work is to take place, as the case may be, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Governor of Maryland, or Governor of Virginia, any public highway affected by the construction of the project may be vacated or relocated by the Authority in the manner now provided by law for the vacation or relocation of public roads, and any damages awarded on account thereof shall be paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">42.</span> In addition to the foregoing powers, the Authority and its authorized agents and employees may enter upon any lands, waters, and premises in the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland for the purpose of making surveys, soundings, drillings, and examinations as they may deem necessary or convenient for the purposes of this Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass, nor shall an entry for such purposes be deemed an entry under any condemnation proceedings which may be then pending. The Authority shall make reimbursement for any actual damage resulting to such lands, waters, and premises as a result of such activities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">43.</span> The Authority shall also have power to make reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, renewal, relocation, and removal of tracks, pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, towers, poles, and other equipment and appliances (herein called “public utility facilities”) of any public utility in, on, along, over, or under the project. Whenever the Authority shall determine that it is necessary that any such public utility facilities which now are, or hereafter may be, located in, on, along, over, or under the project should be relocated in the project, or should be removed from the project, the public utility owning or operating such facilities shall relocate or remove the same in accordance with the order of the Authority, provided that the cost and expenses of such relocation or removal, including the cost of installing such facilities in a new location or new locations, and the cost of any lands, or any rights or interests in lands, and any other rights, acquired to accomplish such relocation or removal, shall be ascertained and paid by the Authority as a part of the cost of the project. In case of any such relocation or removal of facilities, the public utility owning or operating the same, its successors or assigns, may maintain and operate such facilities, with the necessary appurtenances, in the new location or new locations, for as long a period, and upon the same terms and conditions, as it had the right to maintain and operate such facilities in their former location or locations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">44.</span> The Authority may use all lands owned by the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, and State of Maryland, including lands lying under water, which are necessary for the construction or operation of the project subject to approval of the highest-ranking official of the affected jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">Article VI</span><span class="level-heading"> Revenue Bonds</span> </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">45.</span> The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of revenue bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation of the Authority to pay all or a part of the cost of all or a part of the project.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">Article VII</span><span class="level-heading"> Trust Indenture</span> </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">46.</span> In the discretion of the Authority, any bonds, notes, or other evidence of obligation issued under the provisions of this Compact may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, or State of Maryland. Such trust indenture or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">Article VIII</span><span class="level-heading"> Revenues</span> </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">47.</span> The Authority is hereby authorized to fix, revise, charge, and collect tolls for the use of the project, and to contract with any person, partnership, association, or corporation desiring the use thereof, and to fix the terms, conditions, rents, and rates of charges for such use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">48.</span> Such tolls shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of tolls from the project as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues, if any, to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating such project, and the principal of, and the interest on, such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and to create reserves for such purposes. Such tolls shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other authority, board, bureau, or agency of the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Virginia, or State of Maryland. The tolls and all other revenues derived from the project in connection with which the bonds of any issue shall have been issued, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of, and the interest on, such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The tolls, other revenues, or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority.
