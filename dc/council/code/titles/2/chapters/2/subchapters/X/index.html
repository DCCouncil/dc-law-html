                <p>“(2) If the recommendations are disapproved by the Council, the Council’s Committee on Housing and Workforce Development shall transmit a report to the Task Force citing the Council’s concerns and the Task Force shall have 30 days to review the report and re-submit its new recommendations to the Mayor and the Council for approval pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
