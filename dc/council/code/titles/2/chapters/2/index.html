                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html#(a)">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/16-118.html">D.C. Law 16-118</a> rewrote par. (1), which had read as follows: “(1) ‘Beneficiary’ means the signator to a contract executed by the Mayor which involves any District of Columbia government funds, or funds which, in accordance with a federal grant or otherwise, the District of Columbia government administers, or the applicant for any street or alley closing pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/code/titles/9/chapters/2/">Chapter 2 of Title 9</a>, and which details the number and description of all jobs created by a government-assisted project for which the beneficiary is required to use the First Source Register.”</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/17-353.html">D.C. Law 17-353</a> validated a previously made technical correction in the lead-in language.</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/19-84.html">D.C. Law 19-84</a> rewrote pars. (1) and (5); in par. (3), substituted “union and non-union managerial, nonmanagerial” for “managerial, nonmanagerial,”; in par. (6), substituted “government-assisted project or contract” for “government-assisted project”; and added pars. (7) to (10).</p>

                <p>“(2) If the recommendations are disapproved by the Council, the Council’s Committee on Housing and Workforce Development shall transmit a report to the Task Force citing the Council’s concerns and the Task Force shall have 30 days to review the report and re-submit its new recommendations to the Mayor and the Council for approval pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p>“(c) The Task Force shall consist of the following 17 members:</p>

                <p>“(10) A representative of a District job training or education provider, appointed by the Chairman of the Council;</p>
                <p>“(11) Two representatives of organized labor, appointed by the Mayor;</p>
