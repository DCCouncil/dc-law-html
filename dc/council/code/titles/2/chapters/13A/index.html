                <p>The Council finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> On September 26, 1995, pursuant to Mayor’s Order 95-119, the District of Columbia Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs (“Commission”) was established to advise the Mayor and advocate for the interests of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Commission has worked to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Improve the delivery of human services;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Increase the number of Asians and Pacific Islanders serving on District of Columbia boards and commissions and working for the District of Columbia government;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Promote positive relations between Asian and Pacific Islanders and other ethnic groups;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Encourage and support economic development and the historical preservation of Chinatown; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> Provide assistance and support to Asian small businesses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Since 1986, these communities have grown to include more than 17,000 Asians and Pacific Islanders.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The growth of these communities gives rise to the need for a statutorily established office and commission to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Advise and assist the District of Columbia government in the development of governmental programs and initiatives to respond to the developing needs of these communities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Advocate for the needs of these communities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Serve as an official liaison between the District of Columbia government and these communities; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Ensure that the residents of these communities have access to necessary public services and facilities.</p>
