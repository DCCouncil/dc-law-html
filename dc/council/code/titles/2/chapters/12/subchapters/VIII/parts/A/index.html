Such special charge shall constitute the personal obligation of the property owner involved and shall be payable directly to the BID and may be deposited directly into a bank account established by the BID. Such special charges shall not be construed as a BID tax.

Any party to such arbitration shall have the right to initiate judicial proceedings to enforce any award or decision made pursuant to arbitration, but no person shall be authorized to institute judicial proceedings with respect to the matters referred to in this subsection except to enforce an arbitration award.
