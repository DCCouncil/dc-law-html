The mitigation shall be provided on-site, unless on-site locations are unavailable or infeasible as determined by both the DDOE and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Preference for mitigation should be given to restoring degraded wetlands or recreating former wetlands, not creating new wetlands.

Development along tributary streams of the Anacostia River shall maintain a minimum riparian buffer of 25 feet. The DDOE may require a wider buffer along the channel or tributary streams where it is determined that a wider buffer zone is necessary to protect waterways.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Roadways shall comply with the Anacostia Waterfront Transportation Architecture Design Standards developed by the DDOT.</p>
