In determining whether to certify the project, the CFO shall consider the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Whether the project is financially feasible;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Whether the project is one of special merits and there is a reasonable probability that the special merits of the project will not be achieved without the TIF allocation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> In addition to the criteria enumerated in subsection (b) of this section, for projects located in the Downtown Area, the CFO shall consider whether the project will achieve development priorities identified in the Downtown Report that are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and that satisfy one of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If located within a Housing Priority Area, whether the project, for the proposed term of the TIF bonds, commits to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Providing on-site at least 65% of the residential gross floor area required by the DD Regulations for the applicable Housing Priority Area; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Providing on-site at least 65% of the residential gross floor area required by the DD Regulations for the applicable Housing Priority Area utilizing not less than 90% of the leasable area of the floor at street level, and not less than 75% of the leasable area of the floor immediately above or immediately below the floor at the street level, for one or more of the preferred uses set forth in §§ 1710 or 1711 of the DD Regulations with the preferred use space having a clear ceiling height of not less than 13 feet (unless the project is subject to the HPRB review in which case such 13 feet ceiling height shall not apply).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If not located within a Housing Priority Area, whether the project, for the proposed term of the TIF bonds, commits to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Making residential housing as its primary use; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Utilizing not less than 90% of the leasable space on the floor at street level, and not less than 75% of the leasable space on the floor immediately above or below the floor at street level, for one or more of the preferred uses set forth in §§ 1710 and 1711 of the DD Regulations, with all the preferred use space (unless the project is subject to HPRB review) having a clear ceiling height of not less than 13 feet.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Whether located in a housing priority area or in other parts of the downtown area, if a project fails to meet the criteria enumerated in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection, the CFO shall determine whether the project is one of special merits and there is a reasonable probability that the special merits of the project will not be achieved without the TIF allocation.</p>

Upon completion of negotiations, the CFO shall certify the project, and prepare a proposed resolution for the approval of the Council consistent with the results of the negotiations and with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-1217.04.html">2-1217.04</a>.  If the project does not comply with the criteria, the CFO shall so notify the development sponsor in writing stating in what areas the project fails to meet the criteria. The CFO shall allow the development sponsor up to 60 days to comply and cure any defects.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The Zoning Administrator; the Director, Office of Planning; the Corporation Counsel; the Director, Department of Housing and Community Development; and any other relevant agency of the District government shall furnish to the CFO information and certificates as may be required by the CFO to confirm a project’s compliance with the criteria enumerated in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Subject to the consent of each development sponsor of a project within the affected TIF areas and the rights of the holders of its TIF bonds, the CFO may abolish a TIF area, merge TIF areas or alter the boundaries of a TIF area.</p>
