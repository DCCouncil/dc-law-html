                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> After June 25, 2002, the Mayor shall publicly announce and widely disseminate information to District residents that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Describes the functions and purpose of the Youth Council;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Explains the process of selection and appointment to the Youth Council; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A selection committee shall be formed by the Youth Advisory Council Taskforce with the approval of the Mayor. The selection committee shall screen, interview, and select the first 32 members of the Youth Council. Following the first year, Youth Council members shall select the next year’s members. The selection committee shall consist of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Twice as many young people as adults;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Representatives of community based organizations;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Youth Council shall select 6 officers to serve leadership positions. In addition, the Youth Council may create other leadership positions as deemed necessary. In its first year of operation, the Chair shall be chosen by the selection committee from among the initial 32 Youth Council members, with the approval of the Mayor. The Chair shall serve for one year. The selection of these 32 members shall be made prior to the Youth Council’s initial retreat. All other officers shall be selected by the Youth Council at their retreat, and shall serve for one year. Thereafter, the Youth Council shall select all officers. The officers shall be as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Chair;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Vice Chair;</p>

Advisors shall not vote on Youth Council business and shall only provide support upon the specific request of the Youth Council. Four of the 8 advisors shall be adults and 4 shall be youth. In the first year after the establishment of the Youth Council, 2 youth and 2 adult advisors shall be selected by the Youth Summit Advisory Board. The remaining 2 youth and 2 adult advisors shall be selected by the Youth Council members. Thereafter, the advisors shall be selected by the Youth Council.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> To ensure an orderly transition from veteran outgoing Youth Council members to incoming novice members, terms during the first year shall be staggered as follows: Members of the initial Youth Council shall either serve one, two, or three year terms. Twelve members shall serve a one-year term, 12 members shall serve a 2-year term, and 8 members shall serve a 3-year term. Members who are selected to serve a one-year term, shall sit out at least one year before seeking re-election to the Youth Council. Terms shall be determined following the first year of the Youth Council based on two factors:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Members shall be asked to indicate their preference for leaving the Youth Council or staying for an additional term.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The initial Youth Council members who are willing to serve additional terms shall be graded along a performance based system. During the initial Youth Council retreat, all members shall be asked to agree upon one-year goals for the Youth Council to accomplish. Members shall also create their own one-year goals. Members shall be graded on their performance in accomplishing both sets of goals by the 8 advisors in a manner that is consistent for each Youth Council member.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The Youth Council shall establish standing committees. The Youth Council shall have the discretion to create other standing committees as needed. The 4 committees are:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m)</span> Quorum requirements shall be as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Two-thirds of the Youth Council members must be present for a quorum; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> At least one member representing each of the ten groups shall also be present.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(n)</span> Every Youth Council member shall serve on at least one committee.

These groups shall serve as both a source for future Youth Council members, and as a vehicle for soliciting input from around the District, and a method of sharing information about Youth Council activities.</p>
