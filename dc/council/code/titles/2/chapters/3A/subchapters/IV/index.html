                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> After receiving the responses to the RFQ from prospective contractors, the contracting officer shall determine in writing the ranking of the prospective contractors from the most qualified to the least qualified on the basis of the information provided.

The contracting officer’s decision shall not be subject to review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> If the contracting officer elects to proceed with negotiations, the contracting officer shall negotiate with the highest-ranked prospective contractor on price or matters affecting the scope of the contract, so long as the terms of the final contract are within the scope of the request for proposals. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the highest-ranked prospective contractor, the contracting officer may negotiate the terms of the contract with the 2nd most qualified prospective contractor or lower-ranked prospective contractors in order of ranking until a satisfactory contract can be awarded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(3)">(3)</span> The contracting officer may reopen negotiations with any prospective contractor with whom negotiations were terminated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(4)">(4)</span> The contracting officer may make changes within the general scope of the RFP but shall then provide all offerors an opportunity to submit their best and final offers.</p>
