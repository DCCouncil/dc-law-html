                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, a privatization contract shall not cause the displacement of District government employees including by layoff, demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, or time base reductions.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "displacement" does not include changes in shifts or days off, nor does it include reassignment to other positions within the same class and general location.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The privatization contract shall provide the District with an economic advantage, as demonstrated by the determination and findings issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The economic advantage of the privatization contract shall not be outweighed by the public's interest in having a particular function performed directly by District employees, as demonstrated in the determination and findings issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> The privatization contract shall be awarded through a publicized, competitive procurement process pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/titles/2/chapters/3A/subchapters/IV/">subchapter IV of this chapter</a>.</p>

The draft determination and findings shall include, at a minimum, the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The estimated cost of having a contractor provide the service contrasted with the costs that would be directly associated with having employees of the District or its instrumentality or independent agency continue performance;</p>
