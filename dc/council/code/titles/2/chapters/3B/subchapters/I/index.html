                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Upon a showing by the District that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the qui tam plaintiff would interfere with or unduly delay the District’s prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the qui tam plaintiff’s participation, such as:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(C)(i)">(i)</span> Limiting the number of witnesses the qui tam plaintiff may call;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(D)">(D)</span> Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the qui tam plaintiff would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may, in its discretion, limit the participation by the qui tam plaintiff.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> If the District elects not to proceed and the qui tam action was proper pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the qui tam plaintiff shall have the same right to conduct the action as the Attorney General for the District of Columbia would have had if he or she had chosen to proceed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. If the District so requests, the District shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> When the qui tam plaintiff proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the qui tam plaintiff, may nevertheless permit the District to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the qui tam plaintiff, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a report, hearing, audit, or investigation conducted by a District agency, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10% of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the qui tam plaintiff in advancing the case to litigation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Any payment to a qui tam plaintiff under this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds of the judgment or the settlement of the claim.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Any payment to a qui tam plaintiff under this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds of the judgment or the settlement of the claim.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> The portion of the recovery not distributed pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be paid to the District treasury.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)">(4)</span><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)(A)">(A)</span> Whether or not the District proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a qui tam plaintiff who planned and initiated the violation of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-381.02.html">2-381.02</a> upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the qui tam plaintiff would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of the qui tam plaintiff in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)(B)">(B)</span> If the qui tam plaintiff is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-381.02.html">2-381.02</a>, the qui tam plaintiff shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the District to continue the action, represented by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(5)">(5)</span> If the District does not proceed with the action and the qui tam plaintiff conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorneys fees and expenses necessarily incurred if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the qui tam plaintiff was frivolous, vexatious, or brought solely for purposes of harassment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(6)">(6)</span><span class="level-num" id="(f)(6)(A)">(A)</span> Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the District may elect to pursue a violation of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-381.02.html">2-381.02</a> through any alternate remedy available to the District, including an administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the qui tam plaintiff shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the qui tam action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(6)(B)">(B)</span> For the purposes of this paragraph, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> Upon a further showing that the District or the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the qui tam action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings, the court may extend the stay of discovery provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> Any showing provided for under this subsection shall be conducted in camera.</p>
