                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Over the duration of the contract, including options, the projected current total cost to the District government of performing the services in-house versus the projected total cost to the District government after the contracting-out, if quality and quantity of service remain substantially the same; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The cost factors to be considered in evaluating the total cost to the District government of contracting-out the program, such as the additional cost of improving any capital assets to be transferred to a contractor, the additional cost of any one-time severance of District employees, the additional cost of contract administration, the value of any improvement to District government programs resulting from privatizing the program, any income to the District government from the lease or sale of District government assets resulting from contracting-out the program, and any tax revenue to the District based on income earned by a contractor who performs the fleet management operations; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Methods to be used to identify and measure the quality and quantity of services so that accurate cost comparisons can be made between District government and private sector performance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> A contract for privatizing the fleet management services referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall include a provision requiring that at least 51% of all new hires to perform the contract are bona fide District residents unless the Mayor certifies that qualified District residents are unavailable to fill the new positions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> If not already required by a collective bargaining agreement, the Mayor shall make reasonable efforts to consult with union representatives concerning affected District government employees.</p>
