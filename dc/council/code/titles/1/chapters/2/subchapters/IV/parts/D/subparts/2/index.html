                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p>Public Law 106-113 in subsec. (a), struck “Authority” and inserted “Mayor”.</p>
                <p>Pub. L. 106-449, in subsec. (a), substituted “2001” for “1999”: and, in subsec. (b)(1), deleted “for an acceptable level of performance and the goal for a superior level of performance” following “stated goal”.</p>
                <p>Editor’s Note Public Law 106-449 purported to delete the following language from subsection(b)(A) of this section: “for an acceptable level of performance by the government and a superior level of performance by the government”. In order to carry out the perceived intent of Congress, following language was deleted from the same subsection: “for an acceptable level of performance and the goal for a superior level of performance.”</p>
