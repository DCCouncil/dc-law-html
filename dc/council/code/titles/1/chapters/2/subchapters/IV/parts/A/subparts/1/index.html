                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> There is established a Council of the District of Columbia; and the members of the Council shall be elected by the registered qualified electors of the District.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Council established under subsection (a) of this section shall consist of 13 members elected on a partisan basis. The Chairman and 4 members shall be elected at large in the District, and 8 members shall be elected 1 each from the 8 election wards established, from time to time, under Chapter 10 of this title. The term of office of the members of the Council shall be 4 years, except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, and shall begin at noon on January 2nd of the year following their election.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In the case of the first election held for the office of member of the Council after January 2, 1975, not more than 2 of the at-large members (excluding the Chairman) shall be nominated by the same political party. Thereafter, a political party may nominate a number of candidates for the office of at-large member of the Council equal to 1 less than the total number of at-large members (excluding the Chairman) to be elected in such election.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> To fill a vacancy in the Office of Chairman, the Board of Elections shall hold a special election in the District on the Tuesday occurring at least 70 days and not more than 174 days after the date on which such vacancy occurs which the Board of Elections determines, based on a totality of the circumstances, taking into account, inter alia, cultural and religious holidays and the administrability of the election, will provide the opportunity for the greatest level of voter participation. The person elected Chairman to fill a vacancy in the Office of Chairman shall take office on the day in which the Board of Elections and Ethics certifies his election, and shall serve as Chairman only for the remainder of the term during which such vacancy occurred. When the Office of Chairman becomes vacant, the Council shall select one of the elected at-large members of the Council to serve as Chairman and one to serve as Chairman pro tempore until the election of a new Chairman.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Of the members first elected after January 2, 1975, the Chairman and 2 members elected at large and 4 of the members elected from election wards shall serve for 4-year terms; and 2 of the at-large members and 4 of the members elected from election wards shall serve for 2-year terms. The members to serve the 4-year terms and the members to serve the 2-year terms shall be determined by the Board of Elections and Ethics by lot, except that not more than one of the at-large members nominated by any political party shall serve for any such 4-year term.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Council may establish and select such other officers and employees as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out the functions of the Council.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> In the event of a vacancy in the Council of a member elected from a ward, the Board of Elections shall hold a special election in the District on the Tuesday occurring at least 70 days and not more than 174 days after the date on which such vacancy occurs which the Board of Elections determines, based on a totality of the circumstances, taking into account, inter alia, cultural and religious holidays and the administrability of the election, will provide the opportunity for the greatest level of voter participation. The person elected as a member to fill a vacancy on the Council shall take office on the day on which the Board of Elections and Ethics certifies his election, and shall serve as a member of the Council only for the remainder of the term during which such vacancy occurred.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In the event of a vacancy in the Office of Mayor, and if the Chairman becomes a candidate for the Office of Mayor to fill such vacancy, the Office of Chairman shall be deemed vacant as of the date of the filing of his candidacy. In the event of a vacancy in the Council of a member elected at large, other than a vacancy in the Office of Chairman, who is affiliated with a political party, the central committee of such political party shall appoint a person to fill such vacancy, until the Board of Elections and Ethics can hold a special election to fill such vacancy, and such special election shall be held on the Tuesday occurring at least 70 days and not more than 174 days after the date on which such vacancy occurs which the Board of Elections determines, based on a totality of the circumstances, taking into account, inter alia, cultural and religious holidays and the administrability of the election, will provide the opportunity for the greatest level of voter participation. The person appointed to fill such vacancy shall take office on the date of his appointment and shall serve as a member of the Council until the day on which the Board certifies the election of the member elected to fill such vacancy in either a special election or a general election. The person elected as a member to fill such a vacancy on the Council shall take office on the day on which the Board of Elections and Ethics certifies his election, and shall serve as a member of the Council only for the remainder of the term during which such vacancy occurred. With respect to a vacancy on the Council of a member elected at large who is not affiliated with any political party, the Council shall appoint a similarly non-affiliated person to fill such vacancy until such vacancy can be filled in a special election in the manner prescribed in this paragraph. Such person appointed by the Council shall take office and serve as a member at the same time and for the same term as a member appointed by a central committee of a political party.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at no time shall there be more than 3 members (including the Chairman) serving at large on the Council who are affiliated with the same political party.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> By a 5/6 vote of its members, the Council may adopt a resolution of expulsion if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that a member of the Council took an action that amounts to a gross failure to meet the highest standards of personal and professional conduct. Expulsion is the most severe punitive action, serving as a penalty imposed for egregious wrongdoing. Expulsion results in the removal of the member. Expulsion should be used in cases in which the Council determines that the violation of law committed by a member is of the most serious nature, including those violations that substantially threaten the public trust. To protect the exercise of official member duties and the overriding principle of freedom of speech, the Council shall not impose expulsion on any member for the exercise of his or her First Amendment right, no matter how distasteful the expression of that right was to the Council and the District, or in the official exercise of his or her office.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Council shall include in its Rules of Organization procedures for investigation, and consideration of, the expulsion of a member.</p>
