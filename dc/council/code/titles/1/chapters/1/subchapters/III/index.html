                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and stationary flagstaffs in the open. When a patriotic effect is desired, however, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when an all-weather flag is displayed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The flag should be displayed on all days, especially on those days designated as federal and state holidays.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The flag should be displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every public institution.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> The flag should be displayed in or near every polling place on election days.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> The flag should be displayed during school days in or near every schoolhouse.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The display of the District of Columbia flag will inculcate a spirit of patriotism in our citizens.</p>
