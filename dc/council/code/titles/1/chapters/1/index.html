                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1).

The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively.

Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The American shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) is an anadromous species of game fish native to the eastern United States and Canada. Spending much of their lives at sea, American shad leave the ocean to find river systems and migrate, or "run," upstream into freshwater environments to spawn in their birthplaces, including the Potomac River.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Once abundant in the Potomac River watershed and considered one of the most valuable commercial fisheries in the United States, the American shad has experienced species-threatening declines throughout the entirety of its native range. A combination of factors have contributed to these declines, such as overfishing, degraded water quality, the recovery of shad predator species, the closing of historic shad spawning waters, and the building of dams for hydroelectric power.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> In response to American shad population declines, the District and others, beginning in 2005, undertook restoration activities, including education, reopening fish passages, manual spawning, chemical marking, stocking, and identification. Since restoration efforts began, more than 10 miles of closed spawning surface waters have been opened and more than 10 million American shad hatchlings have been manually spawned and released.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> In 2011, the Potomac River Fisheries Commission reported that American shad population targets for the Potomac River established by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission have been met and that the American shad population for the Potomac River had recovered. The District will continue its restoration efforts to ensure the future of the species.</p>
