                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If the Board determines, on the basis of substantial facts, that unordinary circumstances or events of catastrophic magnitude, such as a fire or civil disorder, caused or significantly contributed to the number of disability retirements under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-710.html">5-710</a>(a) during a calendar year covered by the report submitted by the enroll ed actuary pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, it shall submit a detailed statement on such circumstances and events to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The Board shall report the amount of such reduction so caused to the offices and officers set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this section. Such reports shall be submitted on or before December 31st of the calendar year in which the Board receives such report of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In addition to the amount authorized to be appropriated to the Fund for any fiscal year under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-724.html">1-724</a>(a)(1), there is authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year commencing October 1, 1984, and each fiscal year thereafter, such sum as may be necessary to pay to the Fund an amount equal to the amount of any reduction, plus interest lost to the Fund because of the reduction, for a fiscal year as reported to the offices and officers of the Congress pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, but in no case shall any moneys be appropriated on the basis of the authorization pursuant to this paragraph except to the extent that any such reduction was actually made.</p>
