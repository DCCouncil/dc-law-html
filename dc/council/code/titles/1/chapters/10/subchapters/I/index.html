                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html#(a)">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § 1-211), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § 1-213(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">§ 1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html#(a)">§ 1-207.14(a)</a>), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

Election observers shall be allowed uniform and nondiscriminatory access to all stages of the election process, including the certification of election technologies, early and absentee voting, and vote tabulation.

The Board shall review all available evidence pertaining to the eligibility of each voter casting a challenged or special ballot, and shall make a preliminary decision about whether to count or to reject each challenged or special ballot based on its review of the available evidence.</p>

                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/13-251.html">D.C. Law 13-251</a> rewrote subsecs. (d) and (e) which had read:</p>
                <p>“(d) If the official in charge of the polling place, after hearing both parties to any such challenge or acting on his or her own initiative with respect to a prospective voter, reasonably believes the prospective voter is unqualified to vote, he or she shall allow the voter to cast a paper ballot marked ‘challenged’, and shall provide the prospective voter with written notification of his or her rights of appeal as provided in subsection (e) of this section. Ballots so cast shall be segregated, and no such ballot shall be counted until the challenge has been removed as provided in subsection (e) of this section; provided, however, that the official in charge of the polling place shall not allow the prospective voter to cast a ‘challenged’ ballot unless such voter:</p>
                <p>“(1) Signs an affidavit under penalty of perjury, that he or she is a registered qualified elector in the District; and</p>
                <p>“(2) Provides identification indicating that he or she is a resident of the precinct in which the ballot is to be cast.</p>
                <p>“(e) A voter’s act of signing a challenged or special ballot envelope shall be deemed the filing of an appeal by the voter of the refusal by the Board’s chief voter registration official to permit the voter to vote on election day by regular ballot, and a waiver of personal notice from the Board of any denial or refusal to a later count of the challenged or special ballot. No earlier than 8 days and not later than 10 days after the date of any election held under this subchapter, the Board shall conduct a hearing on the petition of any voter who cast a challenged or special ballot in the election to have that voter’s vote counted in the same manner as all other ballots cast in that election. The Board shall inform the voter of the dates scheduled for the hearings and the manner by which the voter may learn whether the Board has decided to count or reject the voter’s challenged or special ballot. The notice shall be in writing and shall be provided to the voter at the time of voting. No later than the second Wednesday following the election, the Board shall cause to be placed in its main office, in the main public library, and at least 1 branch public library located in each ward, an alphabetical list of those persons whose challenged or special ballots have been rejected with the reason or reasons for the rejection. The Board shall publish notice of the availability of the list in at least one newspaper of general circulation on the Tuesday following the date of the election. In addition, not later than the Tuesday following the election, during regular business hours, the Board shall maintain a telephone service by which any voter who has voted a special or challenged ballot may learn whether the challenged or special ballot will be counted or has been rejected. At the hearing, the petitioner may appear and give testimony on the question of the decision not to count the challenged or special ballot. The Board shall make a determination within 2 days after the date of the hearing. Any aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the Board to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia within 3 days after the date of the Board’s decision. The decision of the Court in any such case shall be final and not appealable.”</p>

The Board shall publish notice of the availability of the list in at least one newspaper of general circulation on the Tuesday following the election. Not later than the Tuesday following the election, during regular business hours, the Board shall maintain a telephone service by which any voter who has voted a challenged or special ballot may learn of the Board’s preliminary decision to count or reject his or her ballot along with the reason or reasons for each decision.</p>
                <p>“(3) If the Board has made a preliminary determination that a challenged ballot shall not be counted, it shall afford the challenged voter an opportunity to contest that determination in a hearing before the Board. If the Board has made a preliminary determination that a challenged ballot shall be counted, it shall afford the challenger an opportunity to contest that determination in a hearing before the Board. The hearings authorized pursuant to this subsection shall take place not earlier than 8 days and not later than 10 days after any election held pursuant to this subchapter. The Board shall inform the voter and the challenger of the date scheduled for the hearings and the manner by which they may learn of the Board’s final decision to count or reject the voter’s challenged ballot. The notice shall be in writing and shall be provided to both parties at the time of voting. At the hearing, the voter and the challenger may appear and give testimony on the decision whether to count the challenged ballot. The Board shall make a final determination within 2 days after the date of the hearing. Any aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the Board to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia within 3 days after the date of the Board’s decision.

                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/14-168.html">D.C. Law 14-168</a> rewrote the section which had read:</p>
                <p>“(a) If within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election, any qualified candidate at such election petitions the Board to have the votes cast at such election recounted in 1 or more voting precincts, the Board shall order such recount. In each such case, the petitioner shall deposit a fee of $50 for each precinct petitioned to be recounted. If the total cost of the recount is less than the amount so deposited, the difference shall be refunded. If the total cost of the recount is greater than the deposit, the petitioner shall remit payment for such additional costs within 15 days of receipt of notification from the Board that additional costs have been incurred. If the result of the election is changed as a result of the recount, the entire amount deposited by the petitioner shall be refunded. In no case, however, shall the petitioner be required to pay the cost of any recount in any such election if the difference in the number of votes received by the petitioner in connection with any office and the number of votes received by the person certified as having been elected to that office, in the case of an election from a ward, is less than 1 per centum or 50 votes, whichever is less, or in the case of an election at large, is less than 1 per centum or 350 votes, whichever is less.”</p>
                <p>“(b) Within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election, any person who voted in the election may petition the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to review such election. In response to such a petition, the Court may set aside the results so certified and declare the true results of the election, or void the election in whole or in part. To determine the true results of an election the Court may order a recount or take other appropriate action, whether or not a recount has been conducted or requested pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The Court shall void an election only for fraud, mistake, the making of expenditures by a candidate, or the willful receipt of contributions in violation of the District of Columbia Campaign Finance Reform and Conflict of Interest Act (<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1101.01.html">§ 1-1101.01</a> et seq.), or other defect, serious enough to vitiate the election as a fair expression of the will of the registered qualified electors voting therein. If the Court voids an election it may order a special election, which shall be conducted in such manner (comparable to that prescribed for regular elections), and at such time, as the Board shall prescribe. The decision of such Court shall be final and not appealable.”</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/18-103.html">D.C. Law 18-103</a> rewrote subsec. (a)(1), which had read as follows: “(a)(1) The Board shall recount the votes cast in one or more voting precincts, if within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election for an office, a candidate for that office petitions the Board in writing and specifies the precincts in which the recount shall be conducted. The candidate shall deposit a fee of $50 for each precinct included in the recount. If the result of the election is changed as a result of the recount, the fee deposited by the petitioner shall be refunded.”</p>
                <p>The 2013 amendment by <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/20-60.html">D.C. Law 20-60</a> substituted “Delegate to the House of Representatives, Chairman of the Council, member of the Council, Mayor, Attorney General” for “Delegate to the House of Representatives, Mayor, Chairman of the Council, member of the Council” in (a)(2).</p>
                <p>The 2015 amendment by <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/20-167.html">D.C. Law 20-167</a> substituted “or member of the State Board of Education” for “President of the Board of Education, or member of the Board of Education” in (a)(2).</p>

The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall expedite the consideration of the matter. If the Superior Court of the District of Columbia determines that the petition is legal in form and apparently meets the requirement for signatures, both as to number and as to ward distribution, prescribed in subsection (i) of this section, and was submitted within the time limitations established in subsection (j) of this section, and has attached to the petition the proper statements of the circulators prescribed in subsection (h) of this section, it shall issue an order requiring the Board to accept the petition as of the date of submission for filing.

No further action may be taken upon such act until after a referendum election is held. If, however, after the counting and validation procedure for signatures, which takes place pursuant to subsection (o) of this section, the referendum measure fails to meet the percentage and distribution requirements for signatures established in subsection (i) of this section, the act which was the subject of the referendum shall be again transmitted to the Congress for review as provided in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-206.02.html#(c)">§ 1-206.02(c)</a>.</p>

This certification may be by a bona fide random and statistical sampling method. If the Board finds that the same person has signed a petition for the same initiative or referendum measure more than once, it shall count only 1 signature of such person. If a person who signs a petition is found to be a qualified registered elector in a ward other than that which was indicated on the petition sheet, such person shall be counted from the correct ward in determining whether or not an initiative or referendum measure qualifies for the ballot. Two persons representing the proposer(s) may be present during the counting and validation procedures. Should a political committee or committees exist in opposition to a particular proposed initiative or referendum measure, 2 persons representing such committee or committees may be present during the counting and validation procedures. The Board shall post, by making available for public inspection, petitions for initiatives or referenda, or facsimiles thereof, in the office of the Board, for 10 days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, beginning on the 3rd day after the petitions are filed. Any qualified elector may, within such 10-day period, challenge the validity of any petition, by a written statement duly signed by the challenger and filed with the Board, specifying concisely the alleged defects in such petition. The provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.08.html#(o)(2)">§ 1-1001.08(o)(2)</a> shall be applicable to such challenge.

If the address is different, the signature shall not be counted as valid unless the Board’s records show that the person was registered to vote from the address listed on the petition at the time the person signed the petition.</p>

The Board shall conduct an election on an initiative measure at the next primary, general, or city-wide special election held at least 90 days after the date on which the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot. The Board shall conduct an election on a referendum measure within 114 days after the date the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot. In the case of a referendum measure, if a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election will occur between 54 and 114 days after the date the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot, the Board may present the referendum measure at that election.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(2)">(2)</span> The Board shall publish the established legislative text of an initiative or referendum measure in no less than 2 newspapers of general circulation in the District of Columbia within 30 calendar days after the date upon which the Board certifies, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, that the measure has qualified for appearance on an election ballot.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> The petition is not the proper form established in subsection (e) of this section;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(3)">(3)</span> The restrictions for initiating the recall process established in subsection (c) of this section were not observed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(4)">(4)</span> The time limitation established in subsection (g) of this section within which the recall petition may be circulated and submitted to the Board has expired;</p>

The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall expedite the consideration of the matter. If the Superior Court of the District of Columbia determines that the petition is legal in form and apparently meets the requirements established under this section, it shall issue an order requiring the Board to accept the petition as of the date of submission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> Should the Superior Court of the District of Columbia hold in favor of the proposer, it may award court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to the proposer.</p>

This certification may be made by a bona fide random and statistical sampling method. In a case in which an officer elected from a ward is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a recall petition for that elected officer is found not to be a registered qualified elector in the ward indicated on the petition, that name and signature shall not be counted toward determining whether or not the recall measure qualifies. In a case in which an officer elected at-large is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a recall petition for that elected officer is found to be a registered qualified elector in a ward other than what was indicated on the petition sheet, such person shall be counted from the correct ward in determining whether or not a recall measure for an at-large elected officer qualified. In a case in which an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a petition to recall that Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner is found not to be a registered qualified elector in the single-member district indicated on the petition, the person’s name and signature shall not be counted toward determining whether or not the recall measure qualifies. If the Board finds that the same person has signed a petition for the same recall measure more than once, it shall count only 1 signature of such person. Two persons representing the petitioner(s) seeking the recall and 2 persons representing the elected officer sought to be recalled may be present to observe during the counting and validating procedure.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)">(2)</span> The Board shall post, within 3 calendar days after the acceptance of a recall petition, whether in the normal course or at the direction of a court, by making available for public inspection in the office of the Board, the petition for the recall measure or facsimile. Any registered qualified elector, during a 10-day period (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, except that with respect to a petition to recall a member of an Advisory Neighborhood Commission SMD, the 10-day period shall not include Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), beginning on the day the recall petition was posted by the Board, may challenge the validity of such petition by a written statement duly signed by the challenger and filed with the Board, specifying concisely the alleged defects in the petition. The provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.08.html#(o)(2)">§ 1-1001.08(o)(2)</a> shall be applicable to a challenge and the Board may establish any necessary rules and regulations consistent that concerns the process of the challenge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(3)">(3)</span> For the purpose of verifying a signature on any petition filed pursuant to this section, the Board shall first determine that the address on the petition is the same as the residence shown on the signer’s voter registration record. If the address is different, the signature shall not be counted as valid unless the Board’s records show that the person was registered to vote from the address listed on the petition at the time the person signed the petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> After determining that the number and validity of signatures in the recall petition meet the requirements established in this section, the Board shall certify the sufficiency of such recall petition and shall fix the date of a special election to determine whether the elected officer who is the subject of the recall shall be removed from his or her office. The Board shall conduct an election for this purpose within 114 days after the date the petition to recall has been certified as to its sufficiency. If a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election will occur between 54 and 114 days after the date the petition to recall has been certified as to its sufficiency, the Board may present the recall measure at that election. In the case of a proposed recall of an officer elected to represent a particular ward, the recall election shall be conducted only in that ward. In the case of a proposed recall of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, the recall election shall be conducted in one of the following manners unless conducted in accordance with a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election pursuant to this subsection:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(1)">(1)</span><span class="level-num" id="(l)(1)(A)">(A)</span> In the single-member district represented by the Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner at the voting precinct containing the majority of the registered qualified electors; or</p>

The Board shall, pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.05.html#(a)(14)">§ 1-1001.05(a)(14)</a>, issue rules to implement the provisions of this paragraph. The ballots shall be printed with prepaid 1st class postage and shall be postmarked no later than midnight of the day of the election.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(3)">(3)</span> A special election called to consider the recall of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner shall not be considered an election for the purposes of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.16.html#(p)">§ 1-1001.16(p)</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> The Board shall place the recall measure on the ballot in substantially the following form:</p>
