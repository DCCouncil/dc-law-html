                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> A Certified Service Provider shall be the agent of a seller, with whom the Certified Service Provider has contracted, for the collection and remittance of sales and use taxes. As the seller’s agent, the Certified Service Provider shall be liable for sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it processes for the seller except as set forth in this section. A seller that contracts with a Certified Service Provider shall not be liable to the state for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the Certified Service Provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud. In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller shall not be subject to audit on the transactions processed by the Certified Service Provider. A seller shall be subject to audit for transactions not processed by the Certified Service Provider. The member states acting jointly may perform a system check of the seller and review the seller’s procedures to determine if the Certified Service Provider’s system is functioning properly and the extent to which the seller’s transactions are being processed by the Certified Service Provider.</p>
