                <p>Pursuant to this section, the following new regulations were adopted in 1978: The “District of Columbia Noise Control Act of 1977” (D.C. Law 2-53, Mar. 16, 1978,  24 DCR 5293) (as amended by D.C. Law 9-135, July 23, 1992,  39 DCR 4079) and the “Vendors Regulation Amendments Act of 1978” (D.C. Law 2-82, June 30, 1978,  24 DCR 9293).</p>
                <p>Pursuant to this section, the following new regulations were adopted in 1979: The “District of Columbia Noise Control Amendments Act of 1979” (D.C. Law 3-17, Sept. 28, 1979,  26 DCR 229).</p>
                <p>Pursuant to this section, the following new regulations were adopted in 1982: The “Taxicab Act of 1981” (<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/4-89.html">D.C. Law 4-89</a>, Mar. 31, 1982,  29 DCR 661).</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(1) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
