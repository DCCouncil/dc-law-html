                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The surety on any such bond may terminate its liability under such bond by giving 30 days written notice thereof, served either personally or by registered mail, to the principal and to the Mayor; and upon giving such notice the surety shall be discharged from all liability under such bond for any act or omission of the principal occurring after the expiration of 30 days from the date of service of such notice. Unless on or before the expiration of such period the principal shall duly file a new bond in like amount and conditioned as the original in substitution of the bond so terminated, the license of the principal to engage in such business shall likewise terminate upon the expiration of such period. Upon making any payment on account of its bond, the surety shall immediately notify the Mayor.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402 (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <h4>Transfer of Functions</h4>
                <p>Reorganization Order No. 3 of the Board of Commissioners, dated August 28, 1952, established in the government of the District of Columbia under the direction and control of the Board of Commissioners, a Department of General Administration headed by a Director. The Order transferred to the Director of General Administration all of the functions and positions of the District Personnel Board. Reorganization Order No. 21 of the Board, dated November 20, 1952, established a Personnel Office in the Department of General Administration and provided that the functions previously vested in the Board of Commissioners by law or transferred to the Board by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 40 of the Board of Commissioners, dated June 23, 1953, established the Executive Office of the Board of Commissioners under the direction and control of the Board of Commissioners to provide special and clerical assistance to the Board. The Order transferred to the new Executive Office all of the functions and positions of the previously existing Executive Office of the Board of Commissioners which the Order abolished. This Order was issued pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. The above cited Reorganization Orders were revoked by Organization Order No. 2 of the Commissioner, dated December 13, 1967, which established the Executive Office of the Commissioner for the purpose of providing such managerial, budgetary, personnel, secretarial, informational and special assistance as the Commissioner may require in the administration of the Government of the District of Columbia. Certain functions set forth in this Order subsequently were transferred by Commissioner’s Order Nos. 69-96, 71-270, and 71-307, and by Organization Order No. 30.</p>
                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C.
