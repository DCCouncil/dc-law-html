Reorganization Order No. 41 of the Board of Commissioners, dated June 23, 1953, established as part of the Executive Office of the Board of Commissioners under the direction and control of the Board, an Office of the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners to perform ministerial duties for the Board. The Order described the purpose and functions of the Office of Secretary, and provided that the functions and positions of the previously existing Office of the Secretary to the Board be transferred to the new Office, and that the previously existing Office of the Secretary be abolished. This Order was issued pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. Organization Order No. 2, Commissioner’s Order No. 67-23, dated December 13, 1967, as amended, established within the Executive Office of the Commissioner, a Secretariat headed by an Executive Secretary. The Order transferred to the Secretariat certain functions, including the duties, powers and authorities of all officers and employees performing such functions and assigned to the Office of the Secretary as it existed immediately prior to December 13, 1967, and revoked all other orders inconsistent therewith.</div>

The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia.

The Order transferred to the Director of General Administration all of the functions and positions of the District Personnel Board. Reorganization Order No. 21 of the Board, dated November 20, 1952, established a Personnel Office in the Department of General Administration and provided that the functions previously vested in the Board of Commissioners by law or transferred to the Board by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 40 of the Board of Commissioners, dated June 23, 1953, established the Executive Office of the Board of Commissioners under the direction and control of the Board of Commissioners to provide special and clerical assistance to the Board. The Order transferred to the new Executive Office all of the functions and positions of the previously existing Executive Office of the Board of Commissioners which the Order abolished. This Order was issued pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. The above cited Reorganization Orders were revoked by Organization Order No. 2 of the Commissioner, dated December 13, 1967, which established the Executive Office of the Commissioner for the purpose of providing such managerial, budgetary, personnel, secretarial, informational and special assistance as the Commissioner may require in the administration of the Government of the District of Columbia. Certain functions set forth in this Order subsequently were transferred by Commissioner’s Order Nos. 69-96, 71-270, and 71-307, and by Organization Order No. 30.</div>

Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</div>

                          <span>Continuous community input into every phase of development of titles I through XII of section 3 (the “Comprehensive Plan”), from conception to adoption to implementation, is essential to assure that the Comprehensive Plan in all its elements is the valid expression of District residents, property owners, commercial interests, and other groups and individuals in the District. A variety of means to secure community input should be utilized, including advisory and technical committees, community workshops, review of draft texts, public forums and hearings, and other means of discussion and communication. The District government, through its executive and legislative branches, will strive to ensure that the Comprehensive Plan, in all its elements, is both responsive and responsible.</span>

For purposes of this subsection, a major new building is defined as one specifically identified in the campus plan. Further, in order for the community to know as quickly as possible the substitute plans for the site, the review and approval of the new plans are to be done on an expedited basis. If the campus plan site is to remain vacant, or if the existing uses on that site are to remain, then the college or university is required to provide each affected Advisory Neighborhood Commission with written notice of that decision within 30 days of the college’s or university’s decision for movement. In such event, no further review by the Board of Zoning and Adjustment is required.</span>

The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively.

Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</div>

Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</div>

                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</div>
