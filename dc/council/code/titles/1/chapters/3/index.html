                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The surety on any such bond may terminate its liability under such bond by giving 30 days written notice thereof, served either personally or by registered mail, to the principal and to the Mayor; and upon giving such notice the surety shall be discharged from all liability under such bond for any act or omission of the principal occurring after the expiration of 30 days from the date of service of such notice. Unless on or before the expiration of such period the principal shall duly file a new bond in like amount and conditioned as the original in substitution of the bond so terminated, the license of the principal to engage in such business shall likewise terminate upon the expiration of such period.

A variety of means to secure community input should be utilized, including advisory and technical committees, community workshops, review of draft texts, public forums and hearings, and other means of discussion and communication.

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The Mayor shall, in the course of the interagency review of a development project that is subject to the Large Tract Review Procedures of the Office of Planning (10 DCMR § 2300 et seq.), consider whether the issuance of a building or construction permit is inconsistent with the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. If the Mayor finds that the issuance of a permit is inconsistent with the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan, but consistent with zoning, the Mayor shall defer issuance of the permit, and within 60 days, propose amendments to the zoning regulations or maps to eliminate the inconsistency of the zoning regulations with the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the issuance of a building or construction permit that is inconsistent with zoning. The government issuance of public space permits shall also not be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.</p>

This subsection shall apply only to the construction of new commercial buildings that are not low density commercial buildings.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, a major new building is defined as one specifically identified in the campus plan. Further, in order for the community to know as quickly as possible the substitute plans for the site, the review and approval of the new plans are to be done on an expedited basis. If the campus plan site is to remain vacant, or if the existing uses on that site are to remain, then the college or university is required to provide each affected Advisory Neighborhood Commission with written notice of that decision within 30 days of the college’s or university’s decision for movement. In such event, no further review by the Board of Zoning and Adjustment is required.</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To reduce a shortage of affordable housing in the District which has been caused in part by increased demand for this housing from employees of new commercial development who compete with present residents for scarce, vacant affordable housing, and by high land values which raise the cost of housing and which are partly a function of the demand for additional commercial office space in the National Capital; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> To increase the income tax base and labor force in the District by providing a mechanism to stimulate the development and expansion of housing for employees in the District who cannot afford to reside in the District.</p>

The Executive Director of the Office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions shall serve as a non-voting Trustee. The Trustees shall have exclusive authority and discretion in its fiduciary capacity to manage and control the Fund.

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Each Advisory Neighborhood Commission may become a participant of the Fund upon payment to the Fund of an annual contribution at the beginning of the fiscal year in an amount to be determined by the Trustees. A Commission shall be eligible to participate in the Fund if the treasurer and the Chairperson of the Commission agree, on a form to be provided by the Trustees, to be personally liable to the Fund for any sum paid out by the Fund as a result of the treasurer or Chairperson’s wrongful misappropriation or loss of Commission monies.</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If a participating Commission suffers a monetary loss that may be reimbursed by the Fund, the Commission may request reimbursement upon a written application form provided by the Trustees. The application form shall be signed by a majority of the members of the participating Commission on a form provided by the Trustees. The Trustees shall consider the request at a public meeting held in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.42.html">1-207.42</a>. Notice of the meeting shall be published in the District of Columbia Register no later than 30 days prior to the meeting and shall be sent by registered mail to the Chairperson of the Commission and the treasurer of the Commission at the time that the loss was incurred.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Assets of the Fund shall be held in an interest bearing account located in the District of Columbia.</p>
