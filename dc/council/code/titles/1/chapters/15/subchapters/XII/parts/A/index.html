                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">The overall mission of the Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development is to coordinate training and development services provided to both Government employees and residents of the District to meet the technological demands of today’s and tomorrow’s workplace. The people of this city are its most precious commodity and they have a much greater capacity for productivity than has been realized. The greatest missing factor is investment in their potential to make them more competitive. Quality results begin with a quality investment in our human resources which is key to addressing many of our complex social and economic problems in the District. Presently, there is a mismatch between the technical demands of the marketplace and the skills and abilities of our government employees, as well as our citizens. The Human Resources Development Cluster agencies would educate, train, and retrain our workforce to confidently meet the demands of our highly technological environment. Local government sets the tone for economic development and our commitment to a well trained government and local workforce will be a tremendous marketing asset.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">Many large organizations, both private and public, periodically undergo system change based on a change in mission; financial constraints; market and service needs; or in response to technology. The Assistant City Administrator’s Office and the cluster would be established at a time that our local government will be undergoing a Reduction In Force. The proposed RIF is due to our financial condition and the need to streamline the size and structure of the workforce. A Reduction In Force is painful, however, something positive will result from this pain. It will change how our government provides services, and provide us with an opportunity to utilize employees more effectively.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">The Human Resources Development Cluster will consist of the following entities: The Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development; the Office of Personnel; the Office of Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining; the Department of Employment Services; the Office of Education; the Human Rights component of the Department of Human Rights and Minority Business Development; and the Office of Government Workforce Training and Development.</div>
