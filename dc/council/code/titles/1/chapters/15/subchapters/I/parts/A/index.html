                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em"><em>Objective One: Capability for Broad Over-View:</em>  A Department of Transportation will be the key mechanism for addressing issues, needs and programs that extend to all transportation modes. The new department will identify rail service needs; perform analyses of the adequacy of the bus system and develop ways to improve it; develop plans and programs to integrate various methods of transportation to expedite passenger movement; promote the development of aviation facilities and their safe use; determine the need for new and perhaps larger transportation terminal facilities; develop the means for a more efficient distribution of goods; and develop a system of bikeways and pedestrianways. In summary, it will broaden the transportation objectives of the city.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em"><em>Objective Two: More Rational Allocation of Resources:</em>  The new realignment of facilities and services should reflect a more balanced approach to the transportation system. At the same time, the realignment should permit the department to obtain a better assessment of the resources needed to operate a total system.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em"><em>Objective Three: Active Coordination with Independent Transportation Modes and with other Jurisdictions:</em>  While the city does not operate the METRO system or taxi companies, the city does have a responsibility to require that these transportation services be adequate, safe and economical. A Department of Transportation will provide the focal point for the city to interact with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the taxi industry, and other owners and regulators of transportation services.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">
                        <p/>
                      </div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em"><em>Office of the Director:</em>  In addition to a Director and Deputy Director, a staff for community relations is being established. The great importance of two-way communication with the community (both residents and visitors to the Nation’s Capital) has led to the decision to give this function direct access to the Head of the agency by placing it in his immediate Office.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em"><em>Office of Administration:</em>  The Administrative functions of the two existing departments are consolidated in this Unit. In addition to the present functions, financial resources management and regulations/legislation have been added here. The goal of financial resources management is to inventory and control all department resources within the context of one overall plan and budget. In order to permit analysis of departmental regulations, Federal requirements, and staff-level review of departmental hearing processes, a unit of regulations and legislation is also proposed.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em"><em>Office of Transportation Policy and Plans:</em>  Overall program priorities will be developed here for recommendation to the Director and, through the Director, to the Mayor and Council. The economic impact of transportation decisions has long been neglected, but will find a home in this Office. Systems planning for all modes of transportation will be established to reflect general policy objectives. Traditional project oriented planning such as is now performed in the Highways and Traffic Department will take its cue and direction from the systems planning staff. Finally, establishment of a social program analytical capability will provide a planning link to community transportation needs.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em"><em>Office of Safety and Environment:</em>  The existing highway safety coordination and safety education functions currently in the DMV form the nucleus for this new Office. This organization will allow for a new emphasis on safety standards for additional transport modes and for expansion of the environmental programs, including social impact and interagency cooperation.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">The four operating bureaus, now identified as the Bureaus of Design, Engineering and Research, Construction and Maintenance, Traffic Engineering and Operations, and Motor Vehicle Services, are based on the present operating responsibilities of the Highways and Traffic and Motor Vehicle Departments. A side benefit to be gained, however, is that better resource utilization can be made possible through implementation of intermodal transportation projects at the operating level.</div>
