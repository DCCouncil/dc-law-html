                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">The Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development, to be created in 1993, will have oversight of all Human Resources Development Cluster agencies and their functions. Funding for the Office of the Assistant City Administrator was proposed in the revised FY 1993 and FY 1994 budget submissions and transmitted to the City Council in February, 1993.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">The overall mission of the Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development is to coordinate training and development services provided to both Government employees and residents of the District to meet the technological demands of today's and tomorrow's workplace. The people of this city are its most precious commodity and they have a much greater capacity for productivity than has been realized. The greatest missing factor is investment in their potential to make them more competitive. Quality results begin with a quality investment in our human resources which is key to addressing many of our complex social and economic problems in the District. Presently, there is a mismatch between the technical demands of the marketplace and the skills and abilities of our government employees, as well as our citizens. The Human Resources Development Cluster agencies would educate, train, and retrain our workforce to confidently meet the demands of our highly technological environment. Local government sets the tone for economic development and our commitment to a well trained government and local workforce will be a tremendous marketing asset.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">Many large organizations, both private and public, periodically undergo system change based on a change in mission; financial constraints; market and service needs; or in response to technology. The Assistant City Administrator's Office and the cluster would be established at a time that our local government will be undergoing a Reduction In Force. The proposed RIF is due to our financial condition and the need to streamline the size and structure of the workforce. A Reduction In Force is painful, however, something positive will result from this pain. It will change how our government provides services, and provide us with an opportunity to utilize employees more effectively.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">The Human Resources Development Cluster will consist of the following entities: The Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development; the Office of Personnel; the Office of Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining; the Department of Employment Services; the Office of Education; the Human Rights component of the Department of Human Rights and Minority Business Development; and the Office of Government Workforce Training and Development.</div>

                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">This transfer would consolidate functions already provided by DCEO, reduce the duplication of services and allow the District to more effectively operate its various energy related programs.

Law 3-132 to serve as the lead agency to develop and implement the District's responses to energy-related problems. Therefore, the transfer of WAP to DCEO would serve to fully implement the law.</div>

                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">POSITION TITLE CHANGE</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">For more than five years, the Office of Economic Development, headed by a Deputy Mayor, has operated under the direction and control of the City Administrator. The position title has created ambiguities regarding the management level of the position and the reporting hierarchy therein. Changing the position title from Deputy Mayor for Economic Development to Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development will more accurately reflect the organizational structure and provide clarity to the Office.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">The authority and responsibilities of the Assistant City Administrator will remain the same as under the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. The functions of the Office of Economic Development (OED) remains the same as in prior years. Although most economic development cluster agency activities will not change, some will undergo restructuring to optimize investment and development opportunities and to improve regulatory oversight responsibilities.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">This restructuring of cluster agencies, coupled with the change in name of the position to the Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development will provide a more structured and centralized agency operation and will define clearly, the role of the Assistant City Administrator.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">CONSOLIDATION OF FUNCTIONS</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">In early 1991, after an Executive Branch review of the activities being performed by the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) and the Office of International Business (OIB), it was determined that a substantial degree of overlap and duplication of functions and responsibilities existed between the two agencies. In addition, the Council of the District of Columbia, in its consideration of the FY 1994 Appropriated Budget, abolished both agencies and transferred certain responsibilities and positions to the Office of Economic Development (OED).</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">Based on the review, the need to economize on efforts and dollars, the need to centralize economic development activities in the District government, the legislative action taken by the Council, and in keeping with my pledge to streamline government, I have authorized the reorganization of the two offices, as cited herein.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">In accordance with D.C. Law 4-42, the "Governmental Reorganization Procedures Act of 1981," this reorganization will be accomplished by the transfer of certain staff and functions of OBED and OIB to the administrative control of the Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development in OED. I have determined that both offices have so similar operational responsibilities that the District would be best served by a unified administration. Not only will this change clarify administrative roles and responsibilities, but it will also provide a sharper focus to the District's economic development efforts with the private business sector.</div>
                    <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">In summary, economic development and related activities currently being performed separately by the OBED and OIB, both of which promote the District in a local, national, and international arenas, should be merged. The centralization of these activities will diminish fragmented, disjointed, and duplicated service delivery and thus, allow the District to promote its marketing campaign and business services more efficiently and cost-effectively.</div>
