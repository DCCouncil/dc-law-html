                <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                <p>The Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development, to be created in 1993, will have oversight of all Human Resources Development Cluster agencies and their functions. Funding for the Office of the Assistant City Administrator was proposed in the revised FY 1993 and FY 1994 budget submissions and transmitted to the City Council in February, 1993.The overall mission of the Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development is to coordinate training and development services provided to both Government employees and residents of the District to meet the technological demands of today's and tomorrow's workplace. The people of this city are its most precious commodity and they have a much greater capacity for productivity than has been realized. The greatest missing factor is investment in their potential to make them more competitive. Quality results begin with a quality investment in our human resources which is key to addressing many of our complex social and economic problems in the District. Presently, there is a mismatch between the technical demands of the marketplace and the skills and abilities of our government employees, as well as our citizens. The Human Resources Development Cluster agencies would educate, train, and retrain our workforce to confidently meet the demands of our highly technological environment. Local government sets the tone for economic development and our commitment to a well trained government and local workforce will be a tremendous marketing asset.Many large organizations, both private and public, periodically undergo system change based on a change in mission; financial constraints; market and service needs; or in response to technology. The Assistant City Administrator's Office and the cluster would be established at a time that our local government will be undergoing a Reduction In Force. The proposed RIF is due to our financial condition and the need to streamline the size and structure of the workforce. A Reduction In Force is painful, however, something positive will result from this pain. It will change how our government provides services, and provide us with an opportunity to utilize employees more effectively.The Human Resources Development Cluster will consist of the following entities: The Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development; the Office of Personnel; the Office of Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining; the Department of Employment Services; the Office of Education; the Human Rights component of the Department of Human Rights and Minority Business Development; and the Office of Government Workforce Training and Development.</p>

                <p>TRANSFER OF THE WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM UNDER THE D.C. ENERGY OFFICE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS</p>
                <p>Prepared by the Mayor and transmitted to the Council of the District of Columbia pursuant to the provisions of Section 422(12) of the D.C.

Energy Office (DCEO) under the Department of Public Works.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">II.</span><span class="level-heading"> Purpose</span> The purpose of this plan is to consolidate functions being performed at both DHCD and DCEO. This transfer will eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort and will allow for a more efficient operation of the District Government's weatherization programs.</p>
                <p>The weatherization services provided by DHCD are consistent with those provided by DCEO. DHCD provides grants to eligible District residents for the purpose of weatherizing their homes (both owners and tenants). The funds for DHCD's operation of the programs are provided annually by the U.S. Department of Energy. Costs for the administration of the program are a part of the grant.</p>
                <p>The DCEO operates programs which provide weatherization services and energy assistance in the form of monthly payments for household energy costs to eligible, low-income District residents. DCEO also provides energy efficiency education and promotional activities for residential, commercial, governmental, and institutional entities in the District. In addition, DCEO provides intervention for energy efficiency in utility regulatory proceedings and legislative matters. DCEO is authorized by law (D.C. Law 3-132) to serve as the lead agency to develop and implement the District's responses to energy related problems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">III.</span><span class="level-heading"> Organization</span> The transfer of the WAP will include the reassignment of one (1) staff position (term), four (4) automobiles, all equipment and records associated with the program, and any unexpended grant funds.

                <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                <p>In a continuing effort to make the District Government a more effective and efficient vehicle for the residents of the District of Columbia, this Administration proposes that the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) at the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) be transferred to the D.C. Energy Office under the Department of Public Works (DPW).This transfer would consolidate functions already provided by DCEO, reduce the duplication of services and allow the District to more effectively operate its various energy related programs. This consolidation would also increase efficiency to the fullest extent practicable as it relates to the weatherization of housing units.The Department of Housing and Community Development receives funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program for low-income persons from the U.S. Department of Energy. These funds can be redirected to DCEO. The D.C. Energy Office is authorized under D.C. Law 3-132 to serve as the lead agency to develop and implement the District's responses to energy-related problems. Therefore, the transfer of WAP to DCEO would serve to fully implement the law.This action will result in the redirection of the WAP grant, the transfer of one (1) staff position, four (4) automobiles, equipment, records and unexpended grant funds.I urge the Council to join me in our continuing effort to improve city services for the residents of the District of Columbia by approving this Reorganization Plan.</p>

                <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                <p>POSITION TITLE CHANGE</p>
                <p>For more than five years, the Office of Economic Development, headed by a Deputy Mayor, has operated under the direction and control of the City Administrator. The position title has created ambiguities regarding the management level of the position and the reporting hierarchy therein. Changing the position title from Deputy Mayor for Economic Development to Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development will more accurately reflect the organizational structure and provide clarity to the Office.The authority and responsibilities of the Assistant City Administrator will remain the same as under the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. The functions of the Office of Economic Development (OED) remains the same as in prior years. Although most economic development cluster agency activities will not change, some will undergo restructuring to optimize investment and development opportunities and to improve regulatory oversight responsibilities.This restructuring of cluster agencies, coupled with the change in name of the position to the Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development will provide a more structured and centralized agency operation and will define clearly, the role of the Assistant City Administrator.CONSOLIDATION OF FUNCTIONSIn early 1991, after an Executive Branch review of the activities being performed by the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) and the Office of International Business (OIB), it was determined that a substantial degree of overlap and duplication of functions and responsibilities existed between the two agencies. In addition, the Council of the District of Columbia, in its consideration of the FY 1994 Appropriated Budget, abolished both agencies and transferred certain responsibilities and positions to the Office of Economic Development (OED).Based on the review, the need to economize on efforts and dollars, the need to centralize economic development activities in the District government, the legislative action taken by the Council, and in keeping with my pledge to streamline government, I have authorized the reorganization of the two offices, as cited herein.In accordance with D.C. Law 4-42, the "Governmental Reorganization Procedures Act of 1981," this reorganization will be accomplished by the transfer of certain staff and functions of OBED and OIB to the administrative control of the Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development in OED. I have determined that both offices have so similar operational responsibilities that the District would be best served by a unified administration. Not only will this change clarify administrative roles and responsibilities, but it will also provide a sharper focus to the District's economic development efforts with the private business sector.In summary, economic development and related activities currently being performed separately by the OBED and OIB, both of which promote the District in a local, national, and international arenas, should be merged. The centralization of these activities will diminish fragmented, disjointed, and duplicated service delivery and thus, allow the District to promote its marketing campaign and business services more efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>
