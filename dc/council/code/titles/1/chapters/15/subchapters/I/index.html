                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter I, Part A.</p>
                <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                <p><p:em>present problems</p:em>District of Columbia activities and functions relating to transportation are presently fragmented among several District agencies and departments.The Department of Highways and Traffic is responsible for planning, constructing and maintaining the District's highway system as well as for planning and controlling traffic flow. In addition, this Department maintains the District's public and metered parking facilities.The Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for testing and licensing operators of all powered wheeled vehicles, as well as for inspecting and registering these vehicles.The Transportation Systems Coordinator, lodged in the Executive office of the Mayor, provides liaison to the Metro operations, evaluates transportation proposals, and advises the Mayor on transportation policy.Each of the above entities provides specific services to the District based on valid and appropriate objectives. Taken collectively, however, these goals are not sufficiently broad to encompass the entire spectrum of District transportation needs. No single authority now exists which can perform an overview of city transportation needs and costs, balancing one mode against another or relating those needs and costs to non-transportation factors such as environmental impact and the broad economic situation.<p:em>plan to establish a district of columbia department of transportation</p:em>In order to deal more effectively with the broader issues relating to the overall transportation needs of District citizens and visitors, it is planned to combine into one organizational entity all related activities and functions now dispersed among the several offices cited above.The reorganization presented in Reorganization Plan 2, with associated charts and tables, has been prepared with three objectives in mind:<p:em>Objective One: Capability for Broad Over-View:</p:em> A Department of Transportation will be the key mechanism for addressing issues, needs and programs that extend to all transportation modes. The new department will identify rail service needs; perform analyses of the adequacy of the bus system and develop ways to improve it; develop plans and programs to integrate various methods of transportation to expedite passenger movement; promote the development of aviation facilities and their safe use; determine the need for new and perhaps larger transportation terminal facilities; develop the means for a more efficient distribution of goods; and develop a system of bikeways and pedestrianways. In summary, it will broaden the transportation objectives of the city.        
        <p:em>Objective Two: More Rational Allocation of Resources:</p:em> The new realignment of facilities and services should reflect a more balanced approach to the transportation system. At the same time, the realignment should permit the department to obtain a better assessment of the resources needed to operate a total system.        
        <p:em>Objective Three: Active Coordination with Independent Transportation Modes and with other Jurisdictions:</p:em> While the city does not operate the METRO system or taxi companies, the city does have a responsibility to require that these transportation services be adequate, safe and economical. A Department of Transportation will provide the focal point for the city to interact with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the taxi industry, and other owners and regulators of transportation services.        
        <p:em>structure and functions of the new department</p:em>The Functional Chart of the planned Department carries out these objectives in structural form. Eight subunits are planned; three at the staff level, four at the operating level, and an Office of the Director. Notes on each of the eight units follow:<p:em>Office of the Director:</p:em> In addition to a Director and Deputy Director, a staff for community relations is being established. The great importance of two-way communication with the community (both residents and visitors to the Nation's Capital) has led to the decision to give this function direct access to the Head of the agency by placing it in his immediate Office.        
        <p:em>Office of Administration:</p:em> The Administrative functions of the two existing departments are consolidated in this Unit. In addition to the present functions, financial resources management and regulations/legislation have been added here. The goal of financial resources management is to inventory and control all department resources within the context of one overall plan and budget. In order to permit analysis of departmental regulations, Federal requirements, and staff-level review of departmental hearing processes, a unit of regulations and legislation is also proposed.        
        <p:em>Office of Transportation Policy and Plans:</p:em> Overall program priorities will be developed here for recommendation to the Director and, through the Director, to the Mayor and Council. The economic impact of transportation decisions has long been neglected, but will find a home in this Office. Systems planning for all modes of transportation will be established to reflect general policy objectives. Traditional project oriented planning such as is now performed in the Highways and Traffic Department will take its cue and direction from the systems planning staff. Finally, establishment of a social program analytical capability will provide a planning link to community transportation needs.        
        <p:em>Office of Safety and Environment:</p:em> The existing highway safety coordination and safety education functions currently in the DMV form the nucleus for this new Office. This organization will allow for a new emphasis on safety standards for additional transport modes and for expansion of the environmental programs, including social impact and interagency cooperation.        
        The four operating bureaus, now identified as the Bureaus of Design, Engineering and Research, Construction and Maintenance, Traffic Engineering and Operations, and Motor Vehicle Services, are based on the present operating responsibilities of the Highways and Traffic and Motor Vehicle Departments. A side benefit to be gained, however, is that better resource utilization can be made possible through implementation of intermodal transportation projects at the operating level.<p:em>expected benefits of the creation of the department of transportation</p:em><p:em>Short-range:</p:em><p:strong>1.</p:strong> Provides a central focal point within the District to deal with issues affecting overall municipal, area, and regional transportation planning.
        <p:strong>2.</p:strong> Provides unified direction over all related activities in setting and achieving District-wide transportation goals, through closer coordination of the various facets of operations and programs.
        <p:strong>3.</p:strong> Permits the expansion of technical and professional planning capability at the operating level without added expense to the District.
        <p:strong>4.</p:strong> Permits greater flexibility for applying available resources appropriately to meet program and project priority needs.
        <p:strong>5.</p:strong> Creates a more effective use of available professional, technical, and administrative staff skills through the expanded planning and resource flexibility capability.
        <p:em>Long-range:</p:em><p:strong>1.</p:strong> Permits acquisition of additional and more suitable skills needed, through the normal process of employee turnover, for dealing with present day long-range transportation issues.
        <p:strong>2.</p:strong> Permits anticipated administrative efficiencies and economies, particularly in the areas of personnel, budget, office services, procurement, and administrative management, through the consolidation of existing administrative staffs and elimination of hierarchical structures now necessary for each of the existing independent agencies.

                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter I, Part B.</p>
                <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                <p>PRESENT PROBLEMThe need for more effective coordination of the District's housing and community development functions, as well as the associated reduction in administrative costs, has long been recognized. These problems were identified by the Commission on the Organization of the Government of the District Government (the Nelsen Commission) as well as by the Special Citizens Advisory Commission on Urban Renewal.<p:em>The Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA)</p:em> is responsible for executing Urban Renewal Plans that have been adopted by the National Capital Planning Commission and approval by the District of Columbia Council after public hearings in accordance with the D.C. Redevelopment Act, as amended.      
        <p:em>The Office of Housing and Community Development</p:em> is charged with:      
        identifying the current and future housing and community development needs of the District of Columbia;developing a strategy for best meeting those needs; andensuring the planning and coordination of programs, projects and other activities necessary to carry out that strategy.<p:em>The National Capital Housing Authority</p:em> is responsible for the management of the more than 11,800 dwelling units which comprise the District of Columbia's public housing stock and, in addition, is responsible for the development and identification of new housing resources.      
        <p:em>The D.C. Model Cities Program</p:em> carries out a combined program of housing and economic development and related social support services in a selected area (Service Area Six) of the District, as authorized and funded by the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966.      
        <p:em>The Housing, Zoning and Building Code Enforcement Bureau of the Department of Economic Development</p:em> is responsible for providing community protection through an extensive program of examining buildings - structures, equipment, and plans for compliance with applicable D.C. codes.      
        PLAN TO ESTABLISH A DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENTThis plan consolidates the activities of a number of offices and agencies: the Office of Housing and Community Development, the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, the National Capital Housing Authority, the Model Cities Commission, and the Housing, Building, and Zoning Divisions of the Department of Economic Development. These functions are placed in a single Department under a Director who, in addition, is designated as the National Capital Housing Authority and who is also delegated authority to prescribe the by-laws, rules, and regulations which govern the exercise of the powers of the Redevelopment Land Agency. Staff support services for the Board for the Condemnation of Insanitary Buildings, the Condemnation Review Board, the Relocation Advisory Committee, the Urban Renewal Operations Committee, the Building Code Advisory Committee, and the Mayor's Advisory Committee on Fort Lincoln are also to be provided by the Department.The need for more effective coordination and less administrative complexity is expected to be achieved by the unification of the above functions.A)        
          <p:em>Objective One: A consolidated housing and community development effort:</p:em> The Department of Housing and Community Development will provide the central focus for directing programs that encompass all housing and community development within the District.      
        B)        
          <p:em>Objective Two: A more efficient utilization of Resources:</p:em> By consolidating presently fragmented functions, economies could be achieved by reducing overlap and duplication of effort, newly-formed functions can be funded by a redirection of present resources.      
        C)        
          <p:em>Anticipated Benefits to be accrued by Reorganization Plan No. 3:</p:em>
        Near-term:<p:strong>1.</p:strong> A central entity within the District to address issues affecting overall city-wide community development.
        <p:strong>2.</p:strong> Closer coordination and planning of priorities.
        <p:strong>3.</p:strong> Expansion of technical and professional staff within existing resources.
        <p:strong>4.</p:strong> Greater flexibility for applying available resources to program needs.
        <p:strong>5.</p:strong> A more efficient utilization of available professional, technical and administrative staff skills.
        Long-term:<p:strong>1.</p:strong> Program expansion through redirection of existing resources and through normal employee turnover.
        <p:strong>2.</p:strong> Cost savings by consolidating administrative functions such as personnel, finance, procurement and computer services.
        ELEMENTS OF REORGANIZATION PACKAGEThe supplements of this Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1975 are attached as follows:A. 
          <p:em>Organization Chart:</p:em>This chart outlines the structure of the new Department.
        B. 
          <p:em>Functional Statement:</p:em> A list, keyed to the chart, of the functions of the principal units.      
        C. 
          <p:em>Schedule of Existing Positions:</p:em> The first purpose of this printout is to indicate the tentative arrangement of positions along functional lines within the Department. This is not a proposed realignment. The second purpose is to list every position, filled or not, the grade, salary, job title, and the source of funding.      
        D. 
          <p:em>Reorganization Process Timetable:</p:em> The timetable for full implementation of the desired reorganization.      
        CONCLUSIONIt is my belief that this Reorganization Plan will substantially improve the capability of the District Government to plan, coordinate, and carry out its housing and community development program.</p>
