                  <p>The Department of Highways and Traffic is responsible for planning, constructing and maintaining the District's highway system as well as for planning and controlling traffic flow. In addition, this Department maintains the District's public and metered parking facilities.</p>
                  <p>The Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for testing and licensing operators of all powered wheeled vehicles, as well as for inspecting and registering these vehicles.</p>
                  <p>The Transportation Systems Coordinator, lodged in the Executive office of the Mayor, provides liaison to the Metro operations, evaluates transportation proposals, and advises the Mayor on transportation policy.</p>
                  <p>Each of the above entities provides specific services to the District based on valid and appropriate objectives. Taken collectively, however, these goals are not sufficiently broad to encompass the entire spectrum of District transportation needs. No single authority now exists which can perform an overview of city transportation needs and costs, balancing one mode against another or relating those needs and costs to non-transportation factors such as environmental impact and the broad economic situation.</p>
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic; ">plan to establish a district of columbia</span>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic; ">department of transportation</span>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to deal more effectively with the broader issues relating to the overall transportation needs of District citizens and visitors, it is planned to combine into one organizational entity all related activities and functions now dispersed among the several offices cited above.</p>
                  <p>The reorganization presented in Reorganization Plan 2, with associated charts and tables, has been prepared with three objectives in mind:</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Objective One: Capability for Broad Over-View: </span>A Department of Transportation will be the key mechanism for addressing issues, needs and programs that extend to all transportation modes. The new department will identify rail service needs; perform analyses of the adequacy of the bus system and develop ways to improve it; develop plans and programs to integrate various methods of transportation to expedite passenger movement; promote the development of aviation facilities and their safe use; determine the need for new and perhaps larger transportation terminal facilities; develop the means for a more efficient distribution of goods; and develop a system of bikeways and pedestrianways. In summary, it will broaden the transportation objectives of the city.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Objective Two: More Rational Allocation of Resources: </span>The new realignment of facilities and services should reflect a more balanced approach to the transportation system. At the same time, the realignment should permit the department to obtain a better assessment of the resources needed to operate a total system.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Objective Three: Active Coordination with Independent Transportation Modes and with other Jurisdictions: </span>While the city does not operate the METRO system or taxi companies, the city does have a responsibility to require that these transportation services be adequate, safe and economical. A Department of Transportation will provide the focal point for the city to interact with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the taxi industry, and other owners and regulators of transportation services.</p>
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic; ">structure and functions of the new department</span>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Functional Chart of the planned Department carries out these objectives in structural form. Eight subunits are planned; three at the staff level, four at the operating level, and an Office of the Director. Notes on each of the eight units follow:</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Office of the Director: </span>In addition to a Director and Deputy Director, a staff for community relations is being established. The great importance of two-way communication with the community (both residents and visitors to the Nation's Capital) has led to the decision to give this function direct access to the Head of the agency by placing it in his immediate Office.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Office of Administration: </span>The Administrative functions of the two existing departments are consolidated in this Unit. In addition to the present functions, financial resources management and regulations/legislation have been added here. The goal of financial resources management is to inventory and control all department resources within the context of one overall plan and budget. In order to permit analysis of departmental regulations, Federal requirements, and staff-level review of departmental hearing processes, a unit of regulations and legislation is also proposed.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Office of Transportation Policy and Plans: </span>Overall program priorities will be developed here for recommendation to the Director and, through the Director, to the Mayor and Council. The economic impact of transportation decisions has long been neglected, but will find a home in this Office. Systems planning for all modes of transportation will be established to reflect general policy objectives. Traditional project oriented planning such as is now performed in the Highways and Traffic Department will take its cue and direction from the systems planning staff. Finally, establishment of a social program analytical capability will provide a planning link to community transportation needs.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">Office of Safety and Environment: </span>The existing highway safety coordination and safety education functions currently in the DMV form the nucleus for this new Office. This organization will allow for a new emphasis on safety standards for additional transport modes and for expansion of the environmental programs, including social impact and interagency cooperation.</p>
                  <p>The four operating bureaus, now identified as the Bureaus of Design, Engineering and Research, Construction and Maintenance, Traffic Engineering and Operations, and Motor Vehicle Services, are based on the present operating responsibilities of the Highways and Traffic and Motor Vehicle Departments. A side benefit to be gained, however, is that better resource utilization can be made possible through implementation of intermodal transportation projects at the operating level.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>PRESENT PROBLEM</p>
                  <p>The need for more effective coordination of the District's housing and community development functions, as well as the associated reduction in administrative costs, has long been recognized. These problems were identified by the Commission on the Organization of the Government of the District Government (the Nelsen Commission) as well as by the Special Citizens Advisory Commission on Urban Renewal.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">The Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) </span>is responsible for executing Urban Renewal Plans that have been adopted by the National Capital Planning Commission and approval by the District of Columbia Council after public hearings in accordance with the D.C.

                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">The Office of Housing and Community Development </span>is charged with:</p>

                  <p>developing a strategy for best meeting those needs; and</p>
                  <p>ensuring the planning and coordination of programs, projects and other activities necessary to carry out that strategy.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">The National Capital Housing Authority </span>is responsible for the management of the more than 11,800 dwelling units which comprise the District of Columbia's public housing stock and, in addition, is responsible for the development and identification of new housing resources.</p>

                  <p>PLAN TO ESTABLISH A DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</p>
                  <p>This plan consolidates the activities of a number of offices and agencies: the Office of Housing and Community Development, the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, the National Capital Housing Authority, the Model Cities Commission, and the Housing, Building, and Zoning Divisions of the Department of Economic Development. These functions are placed in a single Department under a Director who, in addition, is designated as the National Capital Housing Authority and who is also delegated authority to prescribe the by-laws, rules, and regulations which govern the exercise of the powers of the Redevelopment Land Agency. Staff support services for the Board for the Condemnation of Insanitary Buildings, the Condemnation Review Board, the Relocation Advisory Committee, the Urban Renewal Operations Committee, the Building Code Advisory Committee, and the Mayor's Advisory Committee on Fort Lincoln are also to be provided by the Department.</p>
                  <p>The need for more effective coordination and less administrative complexity is expected to be achieved by the unification of the above functions.</p>

              <span style="font-style: italic; ">Objective One: A consolidated housing and community development effort: </span>

                  <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                  <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter II, Part A.</p>
                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>This Administration has for some time recognized that the labor-related programs and services in the District of Columbia have been organizationally scattered and fragmented. In the past, several administrative initiatives were undertaken to unite major labor elements but these efforts were frustrated principally because a major organizational component was by law a Federal agency. This impediment was eliminated with the passage of "The Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act" which specifically provided for the transfer of the D.C. Manpower Administration from the United States Department of Labor to the District of Columbia Government. As a result of this new opportunity, I appointed a select executive Task Force on Labor, chaired by the City Administrator, to recommend to me a design for a District of Columbia Department of Labor with the objective of consolidating in this new Department the responsibilities for the major labor-related programs and services provided by this Government.</p>
                  <p>The enclosed Reorganization Plan embodies the results of the Task Force's extensive review of the District's labor-related services, and, thus, represents a practical and measured judgment concerning those activities to be housed in the new Department. It is our strong conviction that this new Department has a unique potential for delivering coordinated labor related services which will enhance our citizens economic security, physical well-being, and productivity as workers as well as the potential for future expansion to include other labor related activities.</p>
                  <p>Further, the combination of programs centralized in this new Department will provide a concentration of specialized resources which can be tapped to support and strengthen other major policy initiatives of our Government, such as those in economic development and housing.</p>
                  <p>A. SUMMARY OF THE PLAN:</p>
                  <p>The Plan consolidates in the proposed Department of Labor the following organizations and/or programs:</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">The Department of Manpower </span>- all its current services, programs, and responsibilities.</p>
                  <p><span style="font-style: italic; ">The District Unemployment Compensation Board </span>- all its current services, programs, and responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>From the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Board, the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Divisions - all of their current programs and responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>From the Office of Budget and Management Systems, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Staff and all its services, programs, and responsibilities under Titles II and VI of the Federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA).</p>
                  <p>There are five boards affected by this reorganization: The District Unemployment Compensation Board, the Employment Security Board, the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Board, the Apprenticeship Council, and the Manpower Services Planning Advisory Council. Under the proposed Department, an Employment Security Board has been created to replace the District Unemployment Compensation Board and the Employment Security Board. Also in anticipation of an approved D.C. Occupational Safety and Health State Plan, the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Board has been abolished and two separate Boards established: the Wage-Hour Board and the Occupational Safety and Health Board.</p>
                  <p>At some date subsequent to this reorganization plan, we plan to develop proposed legislation for a locally administered workmen's compensation law. Currently this worker protection is provided through the United States Department of Labor under provisions of the Federal Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, as well as, under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Upon passage of a local compensation act, we would expect that its provisions would be administered by the Department proposed by this Plan.</p>
                  <p>Organizationally, the Plan presents a Department with three major line operations and two major staff offices. The line elements are:</p>
                  <p>The Staff offices would consist of:</p>
                  <p>B. EXPECTED BENEFITS</p>
                  <p>In the short run, we would expect to discern the following benefits:</p>
                  <p>An improvement in labor-related planning, policy development, budget formulation, accountability, management control, coordination and responsiveness in the Executive Branch of the District Government through a reduction in the executive span of control.</p>
                  <p>An improvement of service delivery through the organizational linking of the District's State Employment Service with its Unemployment Insurance program to form a traditional Employment Security System with services delivered in approximately seven community job centers.</p>
                  <p>Improved coordination of both employment service and unemployment insurance services with all programs administered by the Department under the District's Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program (CETA).</p>
                  <p>Improved coordination in planning and administration of programs under the different Titles of the Federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act through the consolidation of all responsibility in the new Department.</p>
                  <p>Improved relationship with the Federal Government by establishing a single point of contact and accountability in the District Government for all major programs funded through and by the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
                  <p>Improved understanding of the functions and trends in the local labor market through the organizational consolidation of units collecting and analyzing various sources of labor information.</p>
                  <p>Improved inter-departmental coordination of policy development, planning, and program implementation, especially for manpower/labor and economic development plans of the executive branch.</p>
                  <p>Over a longer period of time, we would expect that benefits would accrue through:</p>

                  <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                  <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter III, Part A.</p>
                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>The Department of Human Resources was created in 1970 by the merger of the Departments of Vocational Rehabilitation, Public Health, Public Welfare, and Veterans Affairs. Its resources now include approximately 8,000 employees and a budget of over $440 million.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this consolidation was to assure that public health and social services programs responded to the needs of individuals and families in an integrated and holistic fashion. The structure was intended to enable citizens to obtain in unified centers the information, forms, and counseling they required to participate in programs to which they were entitled. It would also enable managers to coordinate and take account of all the factors that should go into policies and decisions about resources and priorities.</p>
                  <p>However, this valid and important promise has never been fully realized. Nor has the quality of health care, rehabilitation services, income maintenance programs, and child, youth and family services over this decade been as high as the citizens of the District expect and deserve.</p>
                  <p>One of the chief goals of this Administration is to improve and coordinate those services. The heart of any government lies in the quality of its response to people in need. Citizens of the District have the right to expect prompt access to public services when they need them and are eligible to receive them, in a straightforward and courteous setting. Guidelines for services should be clear and available to everyone. Moreover, the quality of public services should be as high as the quality of private services. It is our responsibility to use the planning, regulating and priority setting powers of government to achieve uniform high standards of health care and social services, so that those who need financial help are not relegated to separate and low quality systems. Equally important, it is the job of government to encourage private provision of human services wherever possible, and to be sure that those private professionals who share in public services benefit from an efficient and responsive partnership with government.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore examined our deficiencies in respect to these goals of accessibility, quality and cost-effectiveness. I have particularly questioned the extent to which the organizational size and structure of the Department of Human Resources accounts for the difficulties which clients and service providers encounter, and what structural changes would cure these deficiencies.</p>
                  <p>It was my initial judgment that the most effective way to proceed would be to reduce the size of the departmental bureaucracy and to assure clear focus for independent advocacy of health needs in the District by creating an independent health authority. My transition policy team cautioned me, however, that the issues related to such a separation were complex, and that an immediate organizational decision of this kind would not necessarily accomplish my purpose.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, early this year I created a special task force under the leadership of Dr. Arthur Hoyte to draw up the functional components of an independent health department, and to assess the impact of such a change on health care in the District. Concurrently we have explored other alternatives, carrying out with leadership in the Department of Human Resources, with members of the executive staff, and with community and professional leadership an intensive examination of policy and management issues. We have reviewed the two recent major analyses of the Department, one carried out in 1977 by a Mayor's Panel on the Organization and Management of Human Resources Programs, and the other in 1978 by a City Council Task Force on the Reorganization of the Department of Human Resources.</p>
                  <p>My conclusion is that in order to overcome the deficiencies which now exist in human services programs we must proceed through several stages. The Department of Human Resources is large and complex; it accounts for over one-third of our operating department budget. It carries out many state responsibilities that have dramatically changed and increased over the last decade; its internal administrative structure is not well suited to these changing requirements for state planning and accountability for federal funds. Internal management procedures are weak; the department lacks mechanisms to produce integration of policy, planning and operational decisions at the appropriate level.</p>
                  <p>I am therefore proposing at this time a reorganization which addresses these immediate problems. I believe that we must concentrate on internal administrative and management reorganization before fundamental program and public policy decisions can be effectively staffed and appropriately debated.</p>
                  <p>I am aware that the organized medical community would prefer to move forward at once to an independent health department. Many agree with me, however, that such a separation would not in itself guarantee an improvement in services, and have expressed their willingness to support these internal management improvements as a first step. We are agreed that my proposal does not preclude the alternative of a separate department in the future, if implementation of this Reorganization Plan does not produce the improvement in health care policy formulation and services which is our common goal.</p>
                  <p>This Reorganization Plan therefore contains the first two steps in what I expect to be a continuing evaluation and improvement in health and social services in the District.</p>
                  <p>PHASE ONE</p>
                  <p>The first step, which will take place immediately upon Council approval, thoroughly restructures senior management responsibility and accountability within the Department. It brings together under the authority of those managers the staff and budget resources which will enable them to meet newly defined responsibility to coordinate planning, policy formulation, and implementation of programs.</p>
                  <p>I propose to reemphasize the ultimate goal of the agency by renaming it the Department of Human Services. The Director of the Department will have fewer direct administrative responsibilities, and a stronger mandate to shape overall public policy and service coordination, as well as to set and impose a far higher standard of management performance throughout the agency.</p>
                  <p>At the most senior level of the Department the Reorganization Plan creates two new key positions:</p>
                  <p>In order to achieve a consolidated point of accountability for health care policy and service delivery, and a focus for a more productive engagement of the private sector in public policy decisions, the Plan calls for a Commissioner of Public Health. The responsibilities of that Commissioner will include the grouping of programs now found in three of the Department's administrations and in parts of Executive Direction and Support. I have chosen to include authority for health, mental health, and drug and alcohol abuse services under a single Commissioner in order to emphasize my belief that the health of the body and of the mind are closely related. I expect the planning and implementation of each program area to be improved, and all of them properly coordinated to meet the health and mental health needs of District citizens.</p>
                  <p>The Reorganization Plan proposes a corresponding position of Commissioner of Social Services, with a unified responsibility at the most senior level for rehabilitation programs, income assistance programs, and the services provided to children, youth and families. In consolidating new leadership for social services, I will require a more productive partnership with the federal government and the private sector, and more efficient use of District resources.</p>
                  <p>The creation of these two key positions is accompanied by the dismantling of the Office of State Agency Affairs and the Office of Planning and Evaluation. The offices of the five line administrators (Community Health and Hospitals, Mental Health, Substance Abuse, Social Rehabilitation, and Payments Assistance) are also converted to a different configuration of responsibilities. As a result, the total number of executive level positions in the Department will not be increased.</p>
                  <p>This initial realignment of senior executive staff and program offices will produce several immediate benefits:</p>
                  <p>It will put the necessary staff and budget resources in the hands of senior program managers who have responsibility for shaping policy recommendations and administrative services.</p>
                  <p>It will allow the Director of Commissioners to focus on long-range planning, policy and management concerns.</p>
                  <p>It will provide a clear focus for discussion and development of health care and social services policy issues.</p>
                  <p>It will allow for increased emphasis on policy initiatives such as health promotion, promotion of dental care, reduction of infant mortality rates, and consolidation of programs for youth.</p>
                  <p>It will allow more effective involvement of officials at the program level with those at the planning and evaluation level, to the advantage of both.</p>
                  <p>It will assure better integration of federal and District resources in the achievement of program objectives, and hold program managers accountable for compliance with local, state, and federal policies and procedures.</p>
                  <p>PHASE TWO</p>
                  <p>The remainder of FY 1980 will be devoted to completing and refining this Reorganization Plan. In the process each major administration, bureau, and office will be reviewed and restructured to achieve clearer and more accountable job definitions for middle management personnel, and to implement important policy objectives detailed in the plan. Additional benefits will flow from this phase of the plan:</p>
                  <p>Improved relationships between program administrators and federal officials.</p>
                  <p>Timely compliance in carrying out state and local planning functions.</p>
                  <p>Better linkage of budget preparation to the planning process, and to policy priorities.</p>
                  <p>Increased program accountability to the public, the Mayor and legislators.</p>
                  <p>Improved administrative procedures for data collection, needs assessment, facilities management, contracting and procurement.</p>
                  <p>Implementation of performance standards for personnel.</p>
                  <p>Assurance of compliance with federal and local legislation and regulations governing the Department.</p>
                  <p>Improved standard setting and regulation of facilities.</p>
                  <p>Coordination of services to avoid duplication and encourage the most cost-effective programs.</p>
                  <p>Improved response to legal challenges in respect to services, and implementation of relevant court orders.</p>
                  <p>FUTURE STEPS</p>
                  <p>This Reorganization Plan does not alter the overall functions and responsibilities of the Department, nor does it represent any change in present budget allocations for programs or policy priorities already established in the FY 1980 budget. It does alter the distribution of management resources and responsibilities, and thus provides the basis on which better policy and resource allocation recommendations can rationally and publicly be made in the coming months.</p>
                  <p>Because policy focus and advocacy will be more visibly located, citizens and Council members can have more effective access to decision makers within the Department. Because operational accountability is more specific, the City Administrator will be able to apply the management performance standards which we are generating throughout the government.</p>
                  <p>The effective delivery of health care and social services, in a time of budget constraints and increasing urban needs, is a challenge to every major city in the United States. I submit that this Reorganization Plan is the necessary next step in my continuing commitment to achieving accessible, high quality and cost-effective human services in the District of Columbia.</p>

                  <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                  <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter V, Part B.</p>
                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>The District of Columbia Office of the Surveyor was established by Act of Congress in 1901. The records and plats contained in the Office predate this by a century or more. Among its present responsibilities are:</p>
                  <p>In recent years, builders and developers in the District as well as private homeowners have increasingly encountered delays in receiving services from this Office. My Transition Team initially reported to me on these problems; the Office of the City Administrator subsequently analyzed their causes, including understaffing, an out-of-date fee structure, an out-of-date records management system, the absence of a plane coordinate system in the District, and complexities involved in implementing D.C. Law 2-149 which allows registered private surveyors to certify privately prepared plats and surveys for permit purposes. Based on those findings, we initiated some immediate changes, such as reclassification of some positions and the expansion of the Surveyor's staff by 4 positions to provide an additional field party. Further improvements, however, depend on more fundamental organizational and operational changes.</p>
                  <p>The work of the Surveyor is a key ingredient in several regulatory functions of the District Government: building permits and inspections, public space use permits, transfers of real estate title and applications to open or close streets and alleys.</p>
                  <p>During 1981, the Office of the City Administrator and all the agencies related to regulatory functions, including the Office of the Surveyor, carried out an intensive analysis of these operations. Many administrative and personnel changes within individual offices are now under way to resolve widespread problems of backlogs and outdated procedures. A major reorganization plan to consolidate most regulatory functions in a single agency was drafted, and informally shared with Council members and private sector representatives. The reaction has been generally favorable, and steps toward that reorganization continued. However, we have on further examination concluded that because of the technical and engineering nature of the operations of the Office of the Surveyor it would be more appropriate to combine it with the Department of Transportation.</p>
                  <p>The Department of Transportation, within its Bureau of Design, Engineering and Research, has responsibility for the preparation of plans and specifications for construction and alteration of highway and bridge systems, for maintaining maps and records of proposed and approved grades, street widths and permanent street improvements, and for coordinating and maintaining maps of the location or relocation of underground utility or private installations in public space. To carry out these responsibilities, it directs field surveys, establishes grades, and maintains maps and records similar to those of the Surveyor. This Bureau also makes recommendations for approval or disapproval of proposed dedications and street and alley closings, and for approval or disapproval of applications for surface and subsurface space permits; these functions are also closely allied to functions of the Surveyor.</p>
                  <p>Both offices engage in surveying, perform geometric calculations, draw plats or plans, and make use of similar equipment. Because of these common technical elements and processes, the benefits of consolidation with a professional engineering office outweigh the benefits of consolidation with other regulatory functions. Exhibit A of the attached proposal details further the benefits to be derived from this reorganization.</p>
                  <p>This proposed consolidation of the Office of the Surveyor with the Department of Transportation will not alter the authorized functions of the Surveyor nor does it represent any change in present budget or policy priorities established in FY '82.</p>
                  <p>The reorganization will, however, provide an improved professional and organizational environment, more efficient utilization of resources, and a framework for further management improvements.</p>

                  <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                  <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter VIII, Part B.</p>
                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>This Reorganization is a reallocation of delegated authority. The Departments of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and Public Works are to share the authority to issue grants pursuant to the Water Pollution Control Act of 1984 ("the Act"), D.C. Code § 6-921 [8-103.01] et seq. By Mayor's Order 85-152, dated September 12, 1985, I delegated my authority to administer the Act to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. Since I issued that Order, however, it has become clear that it should be modified to coincide more clearly with the respective functions of, and projects managed by, the Departments of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and Public Works.</p>
                  <p>In particular, I believe a reorganization to permit Public Works to issue grants for projects related to, or affecting, the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant and the improvement of water quality in the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers will result in a more efficient utilization of departmental resources and staff. While the missions and responsibilities of the two departments are related, often closely, Public Works is most knowledgeable of the time, program requirements, technical support and other constraints associated with projects such as the combined sewer abatement program and the Anacostia River cleanup effort. These and similar programs impact upon the operation and plant processes of Blue Plains and the requirements imposed upon the District under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
                  <p>The federal government contributes 55 percent (and in the past contributed 75 percent) of the cost of various construction and water quality projects. The application process often entails a series of deadlines and submittal requirements uniquely and readily within the Public Works' purview. Therefore, in order to maximize the District's responsiveness to both federal grant application requirements and the subsequent release of such funds to District's grantees, I am proposing a reorganization to permit Public Works and Consumer and Regulatory Affairs to share the grant making authority set forth in Section 13 (D.C. Code § 6-932 [8-103.12]) of the Act.</p>
                  <p>Under this proposed change, Consumer and Regulatory Affairs will still have authority to issue grants for projects which fall under its responsibilities as the state regulatory agency for the District of Columbia. Public Works will have authority to issue grants for research related to the construction and monitoring of public facilities designed to improve water quality. Apart from the sharing of authority, no other changes are necessitated by this reorganization. Both departments will continue to obtain federal grants within their existing office structures and will issue grants to local recipients. Consequently, while no reduction in expenditures is contemplated, neither will expenditures increase, because both departments will utilized current staff to administer grant fund.</p>
                  <p>The assignment of these duties jointly to the two departments administering the District's environmental programs and responsibilities ultimately will ensure the public health and safety and the quality of District and regional waters; and there will be no additional burden upon District resources.</p>

                  <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                  <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter IX, Part A.</p>
                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>Education is one of the highest priorities of my administration. I am dedicated to expanding educational opportunities for our citizens and improving the educational system in the District of Columbia, both public and private. This is a cornerstone of our programs for economic development and self-sufficiency.</p>
                  <p>As a step in this continuing effort, I have decided to consolidate some of the District of Columbia educational authorities and services, and to strengthen the role of the District Government in the area of postsecondary education. One such consolidation and strengthening is this Reorganization Plan, and the accompanying proposed amended regulations for proprietary schools.</p>
                  <p>In general, the proprietary schools have served the community well. They have provided trade, technical and self-improvement instruction beyond the high school level to students who did not seek a college education, but who aspired to careers requiring other kinds of knowledge, skills, and abilities. In many instances, these students became employable by this instruction, and upwardly mobile in their chosen field of work. Thus, the proprietary schools provide a service that has important results for the economy of the District, as well as the lives of individual citizens.</p>
                  <p>However, experience has shown that the provision of poor instruction or unexpected closure by a few such schools can have a serious harmful effect on the students. Students typically borrow significant amounts to pay tuition, and if they are left with unmarketable skills or a prematurely terminated education, they may be worse off than before matriculation. In such cases, the individual and his or her family suffers. So too do the other schools, who rely on their reputations to do business. And so too, does the District of Columbia, which loses not only the opportunity for adding to the available skilled work force, but also the opportunity for decreasing the demand for financial assistance to unemployed or underemployed residents.</p>
                  <p>For these reasons, it has become clear that strengthening the regulation of proprietary schools is in the public interest. Therefore, I have decided to transfer this function to the Educational Institution Licensure Commission, and change its name to the Education Licensure Commission. The Commission now licenses and regulates private institutions that offer college level education, and serves as the State Approving Agency for education programs eligible for veterans who get assistance from the Veterans Administration. The Commission members are qualified members of the higher education profession, with experience and expertise in regulating postsecondary educational institutions. The Commission has a fine record of protecting the community from college level diploma mills, and improving the education available to citizens of the District of Columbia.</p>
                  <p>In considering this additional assignment, the Commission has determined that amendments to the existing regulations are required. The Commission has prepared proposed amended regulations, which provide new educational criteria for licensing, new requirements for student records, and new authority for monitoring schools' compliance with the regulations. All of the business licensing requirements are retained. These proposed amended regulations are transmitted with this Plan for Council approval.</p>
                  <p>An increase in the cost of regulating proprietary schools will result from these steps. However, the increase is modest and will provide the resources for the Commission to carry out its new responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>The Plan and amended regulations will further integrate proprietary schools into the educational system in the District of Columbia, and provide the basis for improvements in the quality of instruction received by their students.</p>
                  <p>I urge the Council to join me in this improvement of our educational system, by approving the Reorganization Plan and the amended regulations.</p>

                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1988, which would consolidate within the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) functions related to licensing and regulating security officers and private detectives, is the result of several years of planning between the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) and the Metropolitan Police Department. The need for this reorganization grew out of the original rationale for establishing DCRA. This rationale was to create a central location in the District of Columbia to register and license businesses, individuals and activities.</p>
                  <p>In DCRA's "One-Stop" center for business licensing, the objective or centralizing the licensure functions could not be achieved for security officers and private detectives because of the various approvals needed from MPD. These approvals and fingerprinting were performed at three separate locations outside of DCRA's offices.</p>
                  <p>Now MPD's Security Officers Management Branch is located at the Reeves Center on 14th and U Streets, N.W. Thus, with this reorganization all the licensing functions will be in one location for security officers and private detectives. The reorganization will effectively eliminate the current division of regulatory functions by consolidating these functions within MPD. The result of this consolidation will be to streamline the administration and enforcement of these two business activities. In order to sufficiently carry out these consolidated functions, MPD will augment it's staff by four (4) new clerk positions.</p>
                  <p>Finally, this reorganization will affect only those licensing and regulatory functions which are now being performed by DCRA. Functions related to the licensing and regulation of security officers and private detectives now being performed by other Departments will remain in those Departments.</p>
                  <p>I stand ready to move forward with this reorganization.</p>

                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>The Unclaimed Property Unit of the Audit, Compliance and Investigation Administration of the Department of Finance and Revenue is responsible for the collection and maintenance of all abandoned tangible and intangible personal property reported and delivered to the Mayor for safekeeping and fiscal growth of the District of Columbia pursuant to the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act of 1980, as amended, effective March 5, 1981 (D.C. Law 3-160; D.C. Code, sec. 42-201 [§ 41-101] et seq.). In addition, the Unclaimed Property Unit is required to attempt to locate and return the unclaimed property to the rightful owner.</p>
                  <p>To date, the Unclaimed Property Unit has collected approximately $47 million and has returned approximately $4 million to the rightful owners. As a result, over $42 million have been contributed to the fiscal development of the District of Columbia since the creation of the program.</p>
                  <p>I am committed to the most efficient operation of the District government. To this end, I submit herewith, Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1992 that would transfer the functions of administering the District of Columbia's unclaimed property program from the Department of Finance and Revenue to the Office of the District of Columbia Controller within the Office of Financial Management. The Reorganization Plan would transfer the entire Unclaimed Property Unit, including its staff of seven persons, its property, records and funding to the Office of the District of Columbia Controller.</p>
                  <p>To enhance the efficiency of the District government's operation, the reorganization would align the Unclaimed Property Unit with the Office of the District of Columbia Controller, the office within the District government that is responsible for the financial management of the District and that maintains the official accounts of the District.</p>
                  <p>The Unit's current alignment within the Department of Finance and Revenue does not conform to the Department's general mission: tax administration. Although the unclaimed property program produces revenue for the District, it is not a tax program. Instead, it is more appropriately characterized first, as a financial management and fiduciary service which the District renders to persons who have abandoned their property within our jurisdiction and then second, as a program that generates revenue for the District. Consequently, it is more efficient to place the program in the office that is charged with the management and control of the District's financial affairs.
              <span style="font-style: italic; ">1</span></p>
                  <p>1 Only 12 other states in the country have their unclaimed property programs within their Departments of Finance and Revenue or Departments of Revenue, while 25 states administer their programs through their Treasury Departments or Controller's Offices.</p>

                  <p>The Office coordinates the development of an integrated advertising, marketing and promotional plan for the District which will lead to increased business and leisure travellers to the District.

                  <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                  <p>2001 Ed., Title 1, Chapter 15, Subchapter XI, Part B.</p>
                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>The tourism industry is the heartbeat of private enterprise in the District of Columbia. Tourism is responsible for generating approximately $3 billion dollars in the District in annual revenues. The tourist industry generates much of the activity and business of our city and, for that reason, it is a priority in my economic development strategy.</p>
                  <p>More than 19 million visitors came to Washington, D.C. in 1991 for vacation purposes. Those leisure visitors who stay overnight, stay in Washington an average of 2.9 nights. An estimated 1.68 million of these overnight leisure visitors stay in the District of Columbia hotels producing 2,230,000 hotel room nights for the city. In addition to dollars spent in over 88 hotels, these visitors spend millions of dollars in the District of Columbia retail establishments, restaurants, theaters and on city transportation.</p>
                  <p>While our neighboring jurisdictions become more aggressive, the District cannot afford to stand still. The Office of Tourism and Promotions will work to make Washington, D.C., visitor-friendly. We must help neighborhoods become more aware of strategies to encourage visitors to move away from the monumental core and visit the other sections of the District. The government will place more signs in key locations to direct and inform the visitors. We must establish a first class visitor's center; we have to provide more parking for tour buses, and information for those who use tour bus companies.</p>
                  <p>The District of Columbia cannot rest on its laurels; nor can this government wait for business and leisure travellers to come to our city. The pursuit of the travel dollar is becoming an increasingly competitive strategy among U.S. jurisdictions and international destinations. The state of Virginia spends 10 million dollars annually on tourism promotions. It is no accident that we are familiar with its theme "Virginia is for Lovers." Their national and international advertising budget is $5.5 million, almost 5 times the amount of money expended by the District of Columbia government.</p>
                  <p>It is no accident that we know New York state's theme "I Love New York." Approximately ten years ago in the midst of a spate of negative publicity about the safety of New York City, the state legislators voted to support a phenomenal increase in tourism promotion dollars. This action successfully increased the number of visitors and revenue they generated.</p>
                  <p>This administration will promote tourism as a vehicle for increasing the tax base. It is estimated that tourism generates over $235 million in tax revenue for the District of Columbia each year. This is new money, completely derived from outside sources, that is poured into Washington's coffers. These funds are used to improve the quality of life for all District residents.</p>
                  <p>We have to encourage Washington Dulles International Airport to solicit more international flights that bring high spending visitors to our Nation's Capital. We are reviewing our tour guide examination process which is more than 20 years old. We must inform our taxi drivers, our police, our parking enforcement officers and other front line personnel that tourism is good for our city. Our visitors must be treated with courtesy and respect to encourage travellers to return. These are programs the Office of Tourism and Promotions will coordinate.</p>
                  <p>The District Government must spend more dollars on tourism promotion. I appreciate the Council's support of $700,000 in general revenue funds to be appropriated to the Washington Convention Center Enterprise Fund. These funds will be used by the D.C. Committee to Promote Washington to sustain the Committee's national and international advertising campaigns. I know the Council realizes that even with this appropriation, the District of Columbia will rank barely thirtieth (30th) out of fifty (50) states in comparison to the amount of money expended by other states on advertising. During the next fiscal year, we hope to come up with a city theme that will be adopted by individual hotels and businesses who will do their part to promote Washington, D.C., as a place to visit in the minds of potential travellers.</p>
                  <p>I have frequently stated my desire to make Washington, D.C., an entertainment hub. My enthusiasm for this industry is rooted in the economic benefits of entertainment-related activities. We must do a better job of promoting those entertainment venues like the Kennedy Center, the National Theatre, and Carter Barron. We must bring more international sporting events to our city, e.g., World Cup Soccer and Tour Du Pont. These events generate dollars and provide recreation for our residents and visitors. These events also create contracting opportunities for District based businesses and jobs for city residents.</p>
                  <p>Because our society is fascinated with sports and entertainment, media outlets tend to cover these events more. World Cup Soccer will be viewed internationally by an estimated 26 billion viewers. The District could not, on its own, afford to purchase that kind of advertising. Tour Du Pont, in its first year in Washington, D.C., was carried by CBS sports and ESPN cable live, reaching more than 10 million households.</p>
                  <p>Several motion pictures have been filmed in Washington, D.C., as a result of the successful efforts of the Mayor's Office of Motion Picture and Television Development. When productions are filmed here, revenue is generated for electricians, make-up artists, sound mixers, video companies, construction crews, truckers, caterers, etc. In addition, because of Washington's distinctive skyline, filming in our city also advertises the unique attractions of our city. The City Council wisely voted to expand staffing and increase our capacity to generate over $30 million in annual revenues for local businesses and the District's revenue fund.</p>
                  <p>We have tremendous resources and talents within our borders. My objective is to set priorities in cooperation with key business leaders affected by these programs so that real economic benefits can occur. The public/private partnership between the District government and the Hotel Association on the Convention Center expansion is but one of many examples that we will initiate to achieve our objectives.</p>
                  <p>I know that with your support our goals will be achieved and that the potential of tourism and entertainment promotion in Washington, D.C., will be realized.</p>

                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>This Administration has made economic development a chief priority. As regulator of the District's financial institutions, the Office of Banking and Financial Institutions ("OBFI") has played a vital role in fostering economic development for the District, particularly for low- and moderate-income areas and those areas of the District which are traditionally underserved.</p>
                  <p>To further augment OBFI's pivotal role in effectuating the economic development cluster goals, we propose that OBFI become a separate control center, as distinguished from the current situation in which the OBFI budget is a part of the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development ("DMED") control center.</p>
                  <p>This shift will not result in any changes to the functions, staff or budget of OBFI. Nevertheless, it has become clear that OBFI's significant contributions to the economic development goals of the District warrant the creation of a distinct OBFI control center, comparable to other state banking regulators and on par with the other economic development cluster agencies.</p>
                  <p>I urge the Council to join me in establishing a separate control center for OBFI, by approving this Reorganization Plan.</p>

                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>The Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development, to be created in 1993, will have oversight of all Human Resources Development Cluster agencies and their functions. Funding for the Office of the Assistant City Administrator was proposed in the revised FY 1993 and FY 1994 budget submissions and transmitted to the City Council in February, 1993.</p>
                  <p>The overall mission of the Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development is to coordinate training and development services provided to both Government employees and residents of the District to meet the technological demands of today's and tomorrow's workplace. The people of this city are its most precious commodity and they have a much greater capacity for productivity than has been realized. The greatest missing factor is investment in their potential to make them more competitive. Quality results begin with a quality investment in our human resources which is key to addressing many of our complex social and economic problems in the District. Presently, there is a mismatch between the technical demands of the marketplace and the skills and abilities of our government employees, as well as our citizens. The Human Resources Development Cluster agencies would educate, train, and retrain our workforce to confidently meet the demands of our highly technological environment. Local government sets the tone for economic development and our commitment to a well trained government and local workforce will be a tremendous marketing asset.</p>
                  <p>Many large organizations, both private and public, periodically undergo system change based on a change in mission; financial constraints; market and service needs; or in response to technology. The Assistant City Administrator's Office and the cluster would be established at a time that our local government will be undergoing a Reduction In Force. The proposed RIF is due to our financial condition and the need to streamline the size and structure of the workforce. A Reduction In Force is painful, however, something positive will result from this pain. It will change how our government provides services, and provide us with an opportunity to utilize employees more effectively.</p>
                  <p>The Human Resources Development Cluster will consist of the following entities: The Office of the Assistant City Administrator for Human Resources Development; the Office of Personnel; the Office of Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining; the Department of Employment Services; the Office of Education; the Human Rights component of the Department of Human Rights and Minority Business Development; and the Office of Government Workforce Training and Development.</p>

                  <p>The DCEO operates programs which provide weatherization services and energy assistance in the form of monthly payments for household energy costs to eligible, low-income District residents. DCEO also provides energy efficiency education and promotional activities for residential, commercial, governmental, and institutional entities in the District. In addition, DCEO provides intervention for energy efficiency in utility regulatory proceedings and legislative matters. DCEO is authorized by law (D.C. Law 3-132) to serve as the lead agency to develop and implement the District's responses to energy related problems.</p>

                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>In a continuing effort to make the District Government a more effective and efficient vehicle for the residents of the District of Columbia, this Administration proposes that the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) at the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) be transferred to the D.C. Energy Office under the Department of Public Works (DPW).</p>
                  <p>This transfer would consolidate functions already provided by DCEO, reduce the duplication of services and allow the District to more effectively operate its various energy related programs. This consolidation would also increase efficiency to the fullest extent practicable as it relates to the weatherization of housing units.</p>
                  <p>The Department of Housing and Community Development receives funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program for low-income persons from the U.S. Department of Energy. These funds can be redirected to DCEO. The D.C. Energy Office is authorized under D.C. Law 3-132 to serve as the lead agency to develop and implement the District's responses to energy-related problems. Therefore, the transfer of WAP to DCEO would serve to fully implement the law.</p>
                  <p>This action will result in the redirection of the WAP grant, the transfer of one (1) staff position, four (4) automobiles, equipment, records and unexpended grant funds.</p>
                  <p>I urge the Council to join me in our continuing effort to improve city services for the residents of the District of Columbia by approving this Reorganization Plan.</p>

                  <h4>Mayor's Statement</h4>
                  <p>POSITION TITLE CHANGE</p>
                  <p>For more than five years, the Office of Economic Development, headed by a Deputy Mayor, has operated under the direction and control of the City Administrator. The position title has created ambiguities regarding the management level of the position and the reporting hierarchy therein. Changing the position title from Deputy Mayor for Economic Development to Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development will more accurately reflect the organizational structure and provide clarity to the Office.</p>
                  <p>The authority and responsibilities of the Assistant City Administrator will remain the same as under the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. The functions of the Office of Economic Development (OED) remains the same as in prior years. Although most economic development cluster agency activities will not change, some will undergo restructuring to optimize investment and development opportunities and to improve regulatory oversight responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>This restructuring of cluster agencies, coupled with the change in name of the position to the Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development will provide a more structured and centralized agency operation and will define clearly, the role of the Assistant City Administrator.</p>
                  <p>CONSOLIDATION OF FUNCTIONS</p>
                  <p>In early 1991, after an Executive Branch review of the activities being performed by the Office of Business and Economic Development (OBED) and the Office of International Business (OIB), it was determined that a substantial degree of overlap and duplication of functions and responsibilities existed between the two agencies. In addition, the Council of the District of Columbia, in its consideration of the FY 1994 Appropriated Budget, abolished both agencies and transferred certain responsibilities and positions to the Office of Economic Development (OED).</p>
                  <p>Based on the review, the need to economize on efforts and dollars, the need to centralize economic development activities in the District government, the legislative action taken by the Council, and in keeping with my pledge to streamline government, I have authorized the reorganization of the two offices, as cited herein.</p>
                  <p>In accordance with D.C. Law 4-42, the "Governmental Reorganization Procedures Act of 1981," this reorganization will be accomplished by the transfer of certain staff and functions of OBED and OIB to the administrative control of the Assistant City Administrator for Economic Development in OED. I have determined that both offices have so similar operational responsibilities that the District would be best served by a unified administration. Not only will this change clarify administrative roles and responsibilities, but it will also provide a sharper focus to the District's economic development efforts with the private business sector.</p>
                  <p>In summary, economic development and related activities currently being performed separately by the OBED and OIB, both of which promote the District in a local, national, and international arenas, should be merged. The centralization of these activities will diminish fragmented, disjointed, and duplicated service delivery and thus, allow the District to promote its marketing campaign and business services more efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>

                  <p>[Effective April 9, 1997; projected to expire November 20, 1997].
Statute text</p>
                  <p>STATEMENT</p>
                  <p>Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1995 would consolidate all psychiatric services provided to inmates at the Central Detention Facility ("D.C. Jail") and the Lorton Correctional Facility within the Department of Corrections ("DOC") to improve the medical and psychiatric services provided to inmates at these locations.</p>
                  <p>The genesis of this proposed Reorganization Plan is Campbell v. McGruder, C.A. No. 1462-71 (D.D.C. 1971) and Inmates of D.C. Jail v. Jackson, C.A. No. 75-1668 (D.D.C. 1975), cases active in U.S. District Court. On January 27, 1995, the Court ordered the District of Columbia government ("District") to implement the Special Officer's Initial Remedial Plan for Mental Health Care, Medical Care and Compliance Monitoring at the District of Columbia Jail ("Initial Remedial Plan"), which requires DOC to assume full responsibility for all medical and psychiatric services provided to inmates at the Central Detention Facility and at the Lorton Correctional Facility. The Initial Remedial Plan further requires staff who provide psychiatric services to be hired under the exclusive budget authority and auspices of DOC, and that all staff currently detailed to provide mental health services at the D.C. Jail shall become employees of DOC if they meet the standards for employment. The Initial Remedial Plan establishes staffing requirements and deadlines for hiring appropriate staff. Fines are not assessed for failure to terminate the details to the Department of Human Services ("DHS") staff. However, the District has been fined for failure to hire staff within the time set forth in the Initial Remedial Plan.</p>
                  <p>Under the current organizational structure, DOC is responsible for providing housing, security, general medical care, and other services to inmates, but not mental health services. DHS, through an informal arrangement that began in the 1960s, has provided consultative mental health services to DOC, and in 1980, pursuant to the decree in Campbell v. McGruder, administered and funded an intermediate care program for 160 residents in 2 mental health units. This consultative arrangement was formalized with Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1986, also known as the Final Mental Health System Implementation Plan. Under this consultative arrangement, DHS recommended treatment, but DOC retained responsibility for providing such treatment.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, this bifurcated arrangement did not provide maximum clinical services in an efficient and economical manner. The sharing of information was hampered by the strict confidentiality requirements of the District of Columbia Mental Health Information Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-136; D.C. Code § 6-2001 et seq. [7-1201.01]). Further, the bifurcation of responsibility, whereby DOC physicians treat mental problems and DHS physicians treat mental illness, at times impedes the efficient delivery of services, results in redundant services, and makes tracking of inmates difficult.</p>
                  <p>With the Reorganization Plan, DOC will assume responsibility for meeting all of the medical needs of the inmate population, including mental health, which should improve services to inmates by streamlining the administration and provision of services. To carry out its new functions, DOC will augment its Psychiatric Services Program, established in 1992, by the transfer of all vacant and funded positions and the corresponding appropriated budget from the Bureau of Correctional Services, Forensic Services Administration, Commission on Mental Health Services ("CMHS") to DOC.</p>
                  <p>The Reorganization will not affect court-ordered criminal pretrial and post trial examinations requested by District or United States courts, as these examinations will continue to be the responsibility of the CMHS. Commitments under applicable law following an acquittal by reason of insanity or transfers of inmates to CMHS in accordance with section 928 of An Act To establish a code of law for the District of Columbia, approved March 3, 1901 (31 Stat. 1340; D.C. Code § 24-302 [§ 24-502]), or Superior Court Mental Health Rule 9 also are unaffected.</p>
                  <p>I. PURPOSE</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this reorganization is to consolidate the provision of medical and mental health services provided to inmates at the Central Detention Facility and the Lorton Correctional Facility within the Department of Corrections, to improve the coordination of mental health and medical services, and to eliminate barriers to the exchange of mental health information created by the District of Columbia Mental Health Information Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-136; D.C. Code § 6-2001 et seq. [§ 7-1201.01]).</p>
                  <p>II. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS</p>
                  <p>The function of providing mental health services to inmates in Department of Corrections facilities provided by the Bureau of Correctional Services, Commission on Mental Health Services, is hereby transferred to the Department of Corrections.</p>
                  <p>III. OTHER TRANSFERS</p>
                  <p>All vacant and filled positions, personnel, property and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds available or to be made available to perform the functions set forth under Section II above are hereby transferred to the Department of Corrections.</p>
                  <p>All records relating to the duties and functions transferred in Section II are hereby transferred to the Department of Corrections, except that mental health records shall be transferred only in accordance with the District of Columbia Mental Health Information Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-136; D.C. Code § 6-2001 et seq. [§ 7-1201.01]).</p>
                  <p>IV. REORGANIZATION</p>
                  <p>The Director of the Department of Corrections is authorized to organize the personnel and property transferred herein into such organizational components as the Director deems appropriate, and is authorized to develop any reports and evaluation systems necessary to assess the effectiveness of the Reorganization Plan.</p>

            <section>
                <section class="line-group primary-content">
                  <p>STATEMENT</p>
                  <p>This reorganization would consolidate all psychiatric services provided to inmates at the Central Detention Facility ("D.C. Jail") and the Lorton Correctional Facility within the Department of Corrections ("DOC") to improve the medical and psychiatric services provided to inmates at these locations.</p>
                  <p>The genesis of this proposed Reorganization Plan is 
          <span style="font-style: italic; ">Campbell v. McGruder, </span>
          C.A. No. 1462-71 (D.D.C. 1971) and Inmates of 
          <span style="font-style: italic; ">D.C. Jail v. Jackson, </span>
          C.A. No. 75-1668 (D.D.C. 1975), cases active in U.S. District Court. On January 27, 1995, the Court ordered the District of Columbia government ("District") to implement the Special Officer's Initial Remedial Plan for Mental Health Care, Medical Care and Compliance Monitoring at the District of Columbia Jail ("Initial Remedial Plan"), which requires DOC to assume full responsibility for all medical and psychiatric services provided to inmates at the Central Detention Facility and at the Lorton Correctional Facility. The Initial Remedial Plan further requires staff who provide psychiatric services to be hired under the exclusive budget authority and auspices of DOC, and that all staff currently detailed to provide mental health services at the D.C. Jail shall become employees of DOC if they meet the standards for employment. The Initial Remedial Plan establishes staffing requirements and deadlines for hiring appropriate staff. Fines are not assessed for failure to terminate the details to the Department of Human Services ("DHS") staff. However, the District has been fined for failure to hire staff within the time set forth in the Initial Remedial Plan.</p>
                  <p>Under the current organizational structure, DOC is responsible for providing housing, security, general medical care, and other services to inmates, but not mental health services. DHS, through an informal arrangement that began in the 1960s, has provided consultative mental health services to DOC, and in 1980, pursuant to the decree in 
          <span style="font-style: italic; ">Campbell v. McGruder, </span>
          administered and funded an intermediate care program for 160 residents in 2 mental health units. This consultative arrangement was formalized with Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1986, also known as the Final Mental Health System Implementation Plan. Under this consultative arrangement, DHS recommended treatment, but DOC retained responsibility for providing such treatment.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, this bifurcated arrangement did not provide maximum clinical services in an efficient and economical manner. The sharing of information was hampered by the strict confidentiality requirements of the District of Columbia Mental Health Information Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-136; D.C. Code § 6-2001 [§ 7-1201.01] et seq.). Further, the bifurcation of responsibility, whereby DOC physicians treat mental problems and DHS physicians treat mental illness, at times impedes the efficient delivery of services, results in redundant services, and makes tracking of inmates difficult.</p>
                  <p>With the Reorganization Plan, DOC will assume responsibility for meeting all of the medical needs of the inmate population, including mental health, which should improve services to inmates by streamlining the administration and provision of services. To carry out its new functions, DOC will augment its Psychiatric Services Program, established in 1992, by the transfer of all vacant and funded positions and the corresponding appropriated budget from the Bureau of Correctional Services, Forensic Services Administration, Commission on Mental Health Services ("CMHS") to DOC.</p>
                  <p>The Reorganization will not affect court-ordered criminal pretrial and post trial examinations requested by District or United States courts, as these examinations will continue to be the responsibility of the CMHS. Commitments under applicable law following an acquittal by reason of insanity or transfers of inmates to CMHS in accordance with section 928 of An Act To establish a code of law for the District of Columbia, approved March 3, 1901 (31 Stat. 1340; D.C. Code § 24-302 [§ 24-502]), or Superior Court Mental Health Rule 9 also are unaffected.</p>
                  <p>I. PURPOSE</p>
                  <p>The purpose of this reorganization is to consolidate the provision of medical and mental health services provided to inmates at the Central Detention Facility and the Lorton Correctional Facility within the Department of Corrections, to improve the coordination of mental health and medical services, and to eliminate barriers to the exchange of mental health information created by the District of Columbia Mental Health Information Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C. Law 2-136; D.C. Code § 6-2001 [§ 7-1201.01] et seq.).</p>
                  <p>IV. REORGANIZATION</p>
                  <p>The Director of the Department of Corrections is authorized to organize the personnel and property transferred herein into such organizational components as the Director deems appropriate, and is authorized to develop any reports and evaluation systems necessary to assess the effectiveness of the Reorganization Plan.</p>

                  <p>The Plan would also provide for the Office to purchase insurance for the benefit of the District, place administration of the Settlements and Judgments Fund within the Office subject to the financial management of the District's Chief Financial Officer and repeal the authority of the Office of the Corporation Counsel [now Attorney General for the District of Columbia] to settle claims against the District of Columbia under Part III, A, subsections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Order 50, as amended (June 26, 1953). In addition, the Plan would establish a Risk Management Council and effectively repeal all reorganization plans and executive orders in conflict with the Plan.</p>
