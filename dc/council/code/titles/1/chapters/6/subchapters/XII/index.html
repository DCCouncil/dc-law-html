                <p>“(A) Would impair the ability of the agency or instrumentality to fulfill its essential or emergency public health or public safety functions;</p>

                <p>“(e)(1) Notwithstanding any other District law or regulation, each employee shall be provided not less than 15 days written notice before the employee’s first furlough date and the provision of 15 days written notice shall be sufficient notice to permit the furloughing of the employee on that first furlough date.</p>
                <p>“(2) If an employing agency or instrumentality is unable to give notice in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection for the unpaid furlough day specified by subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section, or schedule the furlough day as required by this act, the employing agency or instrumentality, in consultation with the applicable personnel authority, shall schedule the furlough day on an alternate date in any subsequent pay period on or before July 31, 2011.</p>

A part-time employee serving on a prearranged scheduled tour of duty is entitled to earn leave as provided above on a pro rata basis.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Restored annual leave which is in excess of 30 days shall be credited to a separate leave account for the employee and shall be available for use by the employee for a period of 2 years.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960, which is lost because of administrative error and is not recredited because the employee is separated before the error is discovered, is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-sum payment only if a claim therefor is filed within 3 years immediately following the date on which the error is discovered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> When an individual who received a lump-sum payment for leave is reemployed before the end of the period covered by the lump-sum payment, except in a position excepted under subsection (a) of this section, he or she shall refund an amount equal to the pay covering the period between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum period.</p>

Sick leave may not be charged to the account of a uniformed member of the Metropolitan Police Department or the Fire Department for an absence due to injury or illness resulting from the performance of duty.</p>
