                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> An employee who makes an election pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall, if the need to take time off is foreseeable, request an adjustment of his or her work schedule and obtain supervisory approval of the adjustment at least 10 days before taking time off from work. A request to adjust a work schedule may be disapproved if it is demonstrated that the adjustment would clearly interfere with the efficient conduct of the activities of the entity of the District government for which the employee works.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Notice of an employee’s opportunity to obtain a religious accommodation shall be provided to the employee at the time the employee accepts appointment with the District government.</p>
