The members shall be appointed by the Mayor within 60 days after the effective date of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Mayor shall select members of the Board from persons who through their experience have demonstrated an expert knowledge of the field of labor relations and who possess the integrity and impartiality necessary to protect the public interest and the interests of the District of Columbia government and its employees. Every effort shall be made to select members who have experience in public sector labor relations and preference shall be given to such persons in the Mayor’s appointments to the Board.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The members of the Board shall be selected by the Mayor in the following manner:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> One member shall be chosen from those persons whose names appear upon lists proposed by labor organizations each of which has been granted exclusive recognition for at least 250 District government employees at the time that the Mayor is making his or her selection;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> Two members shall serve for 1 year;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> two additional members shall serve for 2 years; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> the Chairperson shall serve a 3-year term.</p>
                <p>The Mayor shall designate the term of each member at the time of his or her appointment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The Mayor may remove any member of the Board who engages in any activity prohibited by subsection (g) of this section or for repeated failures to attend Board meetings, and appoint a new member in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section to serve until the expiration of the term of the member so removed. When the Mayor believes that any member has engaged in any such activity, he or she shall initiate an action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in accordance with the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-3521.html">16-3521</a> et seq. to remove such member.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Any vacancy occurring in the Board shall be filled within 45 days after the occurrence of such vacancy excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> A member of the Board who: (1) Violates the provisions of subsection (a) of this section; (2) engages in a conflict of interest in violation of the provisions of subchapter XVIII of this chapter; or (3) is convicted for an offense against the labor relations laws of the United States or of the District of Columbia, or for any other crime, which if committed in the District of Columbia would be a felony, which is by this or any other statute punishable by disqualification to hold office, in addition to the other punishment prescribed for such offenses, shall be removed from office as provided in this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The procedure provided in subsection (c) of this section for filling a vacancy resulting from the expiration of a term of office shall be initiated at least 30 days prior to the expiration. If a vacancy occurs during a term due to removal, resignation, or death of a member, the new appointee’s term of office shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term. Appointment procedures for such new appointees shall be those provided in subsection (c) of this section. No person shall serve for more than 2 consecutive terms.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> If at any time any matter comes before the Board in which any member has any interest, directly or indirectly, other than as that of a taxpayer, the member shall publicly so state and this statement shall be recorded in the minutes of that meeting. The member thereafter is disqualified from participation in the consideration of said matter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> Each member of the Board is entitled to compensation as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-611.12.html">1-611.12</a>.

The Executive Director and the attorneys shall be in the Legal Service as defined in subchapter VIII-B of this chapter. The Executive Director shall be a resident of the District and shall remain a District resident for the duration of his or her employment by the Board.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> Three members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> There is established an Office of Employee Appeals (hereinafter referred to in this subchapter as the “Office”). The Office shall be composed of 5 members to be appointed by the Mayor in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section within 60 days of the date this chapter becomes effective as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-636.02.html">1-636.02</a>. Members of the Office shall have demonstrated knowledge concerning personnel management or labor relations, and a reputation for impartiality and integrity in the discharge of their responsibilities. No member shall be eligible for reappointment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The term of office of each member of the Office shall be 6 years: Except, that: (1) Of those members first appointed, 2 shall serve for 2 years and 3 shall serve for 4 years, respectively, from the date of appointment; and (2) any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his or her predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for the remainder of such term. No member may serve beyond the expiration of his or her term, except that a member serving a term of less than 6 years, who was appointed under clause (1) of this subsection, or a member who is appointed to serve the remainder of an unexpired term of three years or less, who was appointed under clause (2) of this subsection, may be reappointed for a full 6-year term. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. The Mayor shall designate the term of each member at the time of his or her appointment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The Chairperson of the Office shall be designated by the Mayor.

The Office may hear appeals brought before it under this subchapter by a hearing examiner. An appeal from a decision of any such hearing examiner may be taken either to the full Office or to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia at the option of any adversely affected party. If an appeal is taken directly to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the decision of a hearing examiner, for the purposes of such appeal, shall be considered as the final decision of the Office. If an appeal is taken from a decision of a hearing examiner to the full Office, the decision of the hearing examiner shall be stayed pending a final decision of the Office. Upon a vote of a majority of its members, the Office may hear de novo all issues of fact or law relating to an appeal of a decision of the hearing examiner, except the Office may decide to consider only the record made before such hearing examiner. A final decision of the full Office, relating to an appeal brought to it from a hearing examiner, shall be appealable to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Upon reviewing the final decision of the Office, the Court shall determine if it is supported by substantial evidence.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> An employee may appeal a final agency decision affecting a performance rating which results in removal of the employee (pursuant to subchapter XIII-A of this chapter), an adverse action for cause that results in removal, reduction in force (pursuant to subchapter XXIV of this chapter), reduction in grade, placement on enforced leave, or suspension for 10 days or more (pursuant to subchapter XVI-A of this chapter) to the Office upon the record and pursuant to other rules and regulations which the Office may issue. Any appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the effective date of the appealed agency action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In any appeal taken pursuant to this section, the Office shall review the record and uphold, reverse, or modify the decision of the agency. The Office may order oral argument, on its own motion or on motion filed by any party within 15 days, and provide such other procedures or rules and regulations as it deems practicable or desirable in any appeal under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> All decisions of the Office shall include findings of fact and a written decision, as well as the reasons or basis for the decision upon all material issues of fact and law presented on record, and order; provided, however, that the Office may affirm a decision without findings of fact and a written decision. Such decisions shall be published in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Office, and shall be published in the District of Columbia Register. Any decision by a Hearing Examiner shall be made within 120 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, from the date of the appellant’s filing of the appeal with the Office. Within 45 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the appeal is filed with the Office, the Office shall determine whether, in accordance with this section and the Office’s own rules, the Office has jurisdiction. Any decision shall include a statement of any further process available to the appellant including, as appropriate, a petition for review or a petition for enforcement and judicial review. Copies of the decision shall be immediately transmitted to the Office and all parties to the appeal, including named parties and intervenors. The initial decision of the Hearing Examiner shall become final 35 days after issuance, unless a party files a petition for review of the initial decision with the Office within the 35-day filing period. In accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-604.04.html">1-604.04</a>, the Office may promulgate rules to allow a Hearing Examiner a reasonable extension of time if extraordinary circumstances dictate that an appeal cannot be decided within the 120-day period. After issuing the initial decision, the Hearing Examiner shall retain jurisdiction over the case only to the extent necessary to correct the record, rule on a motion for attorney fees, or process any petition for enforcement filed under the authority of the Office. If the Office denies all petitions for review, the initial decision shall become final upon the issuance of the last denial. If the Office grants a petition for review, the subsequent decision of the Office shall be the final decision of the Office unless the decision states otherwise. Administrative remedies are considered exhausted when a decision becomes final in accordance with this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Any employee or agency may appeal the decision of the Office to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for a review of the record and such Court may affirm, reverse, remove, or modify such decision, or take any other appropriate action the Court may deem necessary.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> For the purposes of this subsection, an employee is deemed employed for a full biweekly pay period if he or she is employed during the days within that period, exclusive of legal holidays and nonworkdays which fall within his or her basic administrative workweek. A part-time employee serving on a prearranged scheduled tour of duty is entitled to earn leave as provided above on a pro rata basis. Leave accrues to an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods on the same basis as it would accrue if the employee were paid based on biweekly pay periods. A change in the rate of accrual of annual leave by an employee under this subsection takes effect at the beginning of the pay period after the pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, in which the employee completed the prescribed period of service.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> An employee whose current employment is limited to less than 90 days is entitled to annual leave only after being currently employed for a continuous period of 90 days under successive temporary appointments without a break in service. After completing the 90-day period, the employee is entitled to be credited with the leave that would have accrued to him or her since the date of his or her initial temporary appointment.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Restored annual leave which is in excess of 30 days shall be credited to a separate leave account for the employee and shall be available for use by the employee for a period of 2 years.

Sick leave may not be charged to the account of a uniformed member of the Metropolitan Police Department or the Fire Department for an absence due to injury or illness resulting from the performance of duty.</p>

Leave under this subsection shall not exceed 15 calendar days per fiscal year and, to the extent that it is not used in a fiscal year, shall accumulate for use in the succeeding fiscal year until it totals 15 days at the beginning of a fiscal year. In the case of part-time employment, the rate at which leave accrues under this subsection shall be a percentage of the rate prescribed above which is determined by dividing 40 into the number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek of that employee during that fiscal year. The minimum charge for leave under this subsection is one hour, and additional charges are in multiples thereof.</p>

The period of absence may not be charged to sick leave. An employee who is a member of the National Guard of the District of Columbia is entitled to leave without limitation and without loss in pay or time for each day of a parade or encampment ordered or authorized under Title 49 of the District of Columbia Official Code.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> For the purpose of this section:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The term “overtime pay” means pay for hours of service in excess of a statutory or other basic workweek or other basic unit of work time, as observed by the employing establishment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The term “year” means a period of 12 calendar months, or the equivalent thereof as specified by rules and regulations prescribed by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In computing monetary compensation for disability or death on the basis of monthly pay, that pay is determined under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The monthly pay at the time of injury is deemed one-twelfth of the average annual earnings of the employee at that time. When compensation is paid on a weekly basis, the weekly equivalent of the monthly pay is deemed one-fifty-second of the average annual earning. For so much of a period of total disability as does not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the beginning of compensable disability, the compensation, at the discretion of the Mayor, may be computed on the basis of the actual daily wage of the employee at the time of injury, in which event he or she may receive compensation for the days he or she would have worked but for the injury.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Average annual earnings are determined as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> If the employee worked in the position in which he or she was employed at the time of his or her injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury and the employment was in a position for which an annual rate of pay:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Was fixed, the average annual earnings are the annual rate of pay; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Was not fixed, the average annual earnings are the product obtained by multiplying his or her daily wage for the particular employment or the average thereof, if the daily wage has fluctuated; by 300, if he or she was employed on the basis of a 6 day workweek; 280, if employed on the basis of a 5 1/2 day workweek; and 260, if employed on the basis of a 5 day workweek;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> If the employee did not work in the position in which he or she was employed at the time of his or her injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury, but the position was one which would have afforded employment for substantially a whole year, the average annual earnings are a sum equal to the average annual earnings of an employee of the same class working substantially the whole immediately preceding year in the same or similar employment with the District government, as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> If either of the foregoing methods of determining the average annual earnings cannot be applied reasonably and fairly, the average annual earnings are a sum that reasonably represents the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he or she was working at the time of the injury having regard to the previous earnings of the employee in District of Columbia government employment, and of other employees of the District of Columbia government in the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring location, other previous employment of the employee or other relevant factors. The average annual earnings may not be less than 150 times the average daily wage the employee earned in the employment during the days employed within 1 year immediately preceding his or her injury; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> If the employee served without pay or a nominal pay, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection apply, as far as practicable, but the average earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-15 as provided in § 5332 of Title 5 of the United States Code or its equivalent as provided in subchapter XI of this chapter; provided that the average earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for DS-12, Step 10 or its equivalent in the collective bargaining unit for those employees hired after December 31, 1979, who make a claim for compensation for disability after December 29, 1994. If the average annual earnings cannot be determined reasonably and fairly in the manner otherwise provided by this section, the average annual earnings shall be determined at the reasonable value of the service performed but not in excess of $3,600 a year.</p>

If the individual dies before the adjustment is completed, an adjustment shall be made by decreasing later benefits payable under this subchapter with respect to the individual’s death.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a-1)">(a-1)</span> Before seeking to recover an overpayment or adjust benefits, the District government shall advise the individual in writing:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(i)">(i)</span> The term “at fault” means that an individual has made an incorrect statement as to a material fact that he or she knew or should have known to be incorrect; failed to provide information which he or she knew or should have known to be material; or accepted a payment which he or she knew or should have known to be incorrect.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> The term “without fault” means an individual is receiving benefits pursuant to a good faith dispute as to whether his or her medical condition entitles him or her to receive those benefits.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(iii)(I)">(I)</span> Fixed living expenses such as food, housing, utilities, maintenance, insurance, and taxes;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(iv)">(iv)</span> The phrase “against equity and good conscience” means that recovery would cause severe financial hardship to an individual to make the overpayment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)">(B)</span> The determination of whether an individual was at fault regarding an overpayment shall depend upon the totality of circumstances surrounding the overpayment including the complexity of those circumstances and the individual’s capacity to realize that he or she is being overpaid. The government shall consider all pertinent circumstances including the individual’s age, intelligence, and any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations including any difficulty with the English language.</p>

The evidence must be presented or the hearing requested within 30 days of the date of the written notice of the overpayment. The 30-day requirement can be waived for good cause including mental or physical incapacity of the individual or lack of timely receipt of the notice of adjustment or recoupment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b-1)(2)">(2)</span> An individual shall be required to provide relevant information and documentation to support his or her claim of severe financial hardship or that the individual needs substantially all of his or her current income to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses. Failure to submit the requested information within 30 days of the request shall result in denial of a request for a waiver and no further request for a waiver shall be considered until the requested information is furnished.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish a financially sound and equitable program of employee retirement benefits. With respect to retirement systems, the Council recognizes that existing programs, including the program administered by the federal government, are not now financed on an actuarially sound basis. Furthermore, the rights and benefits conferred by these systems and the financial implications for participation by employees vary significantly among systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The responsibility for creating an actuarially sound financial plan for existing retirement systems cannot and should not be borne solely by the District government. The Council therefore fully endorses the proposition that the federal government must assist the District government in establishing and maintain the necessary financial base for all existing retirement systems.</p>
