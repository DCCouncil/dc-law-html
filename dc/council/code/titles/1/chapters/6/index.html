                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> One day for each full biweekly pay period for an employee with 15 or more years of federal or District government service.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> For the purposes of this subsection, an employee is deemed employed for a full biweekly pay period if he or she is employed during the days within that period, exclusive of legal holidays and nonworkdays which fall within his or her basic administrative workweek. A part-time employee serving on a prearranged scheduled tour of duty is entitled to earn leave as provided above on a pro rata basis. Leave accrues to an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods on the same basis as it would accrue if the employee were paid based on biweekly pay periods. A change in the rate of accrual of annual leave by an employee under this subsection takes effect at the beginning of the pay period after the pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, in which the employee completed the prescribed period of service.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> In determining years of service for leave accrual purposes, an employee is entitled to credit for all service creditable under § 8332 of Title 5 of the United States Code for annuity purposes under Civil Service retirement. An employee who is a military retiree is entitled to credit for active military service only if his or her retirement was based on disability resulting from injury or disease received in the line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict or caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in line of duty during a period of war as defined by §§ 101 and 301 of Title 38 of the United States Code [revised; see now 38 U.S.C. § 1101]. The determination of years of service may be made on the basis of an affidavit of the employee.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> An employee whose current employment is limited to less than 90 days is entitled to annual leave only after being currently employed for a continuous period of 90 days under successive temporary appointments without a break in service. After completing the 90-day period, the employee is entitled to be credited with the leave that would have accrued to him or her since the date of his or her initial temporary appointment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> Annual leave which is not used by an employee accumulates for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 30 days at the beginning of the 1st full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a calendar year.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Annual leave in excess of 30 days which was accumulated under an earlier statute remains to the credit of the employee until used. The excess annual leave is reduced at the beginning of the 1st full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year, by the amount of annual leave the employee used during the preceding year in excess of the amount which accrued during that year until the employee’s accumulated leave does not exceed 30 days.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Annual leave which is lost due to administrative error when the error causes a loss of annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960, exigencies of the public business when the annual leave was scheduled in advance, or sickness of the employee when the annual leave was scheduled in advance, shall be restored to the employee:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Restored annual leave which is in excess of 30 days shall be credited to a separate leave account for the employee and shall be available for use by the employee for a period of 2 years. Restored leave shall be included in a lump-sum payment if unused and still available upon the separation of the employee;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960, which is lost because of administrative error and is not recredited because the employee is separated before the error is discovered, is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-sum payment only if a claim therefor is filed within 3 years immediately following the date on which the error is discovered.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> When an individual who received a lump-sum payment for leave is reemployed before the end of the period covered by the lump-sum payment, except in a position excepted under subsection (a) of this section, he or she shall refund an amount equal to the pay covering the period between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum period.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> An employee is entitled to sick leave with pay which accrues on the basis of one-half day for each full biweekly pay period: Except, that sick leave with pay accrues to a member of the Firefighting Division of the Fire Department on the basis of two-fifths of a day for each full biweekly pay period. Sick leave may not be charged to the account of a uniformed member of the Metropolitan Police Department or the Fire Department for an absence due to injury or illness resulting from the performance of duty.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> The annual and sick leave to the credit of a federal employee who transfers to the District government without a break in service will be transferred to the credit of the employee under the District government leave system. The annual and sick leave to the credit of an employee who transfers from a position under a different leave system(s) without a break in service shall be transferred on an adjusted basis under rules and regulations prescribed by the Mayor.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span> An employee is entitled to leave, without loss of pay, leave, or credit for time of service, during a period of absence in which he or she is summoned, in connection with a judicial proceeding, by a court or other authority responsible for the conduct of that proceeding to serve as a juror or as a witness on behalf of any party in connection with judicial proceeding to which the United States, the District of Columbia, or a state or local government is a party.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m)</span> An employee is entitled to leave without loss in pay, leave, service, or performance rating for active duty, inactive-duty training (as defined in 37 U.S.C. § 101), or to engage in field coast defense training under 32 U.S.C. §§ 502 through 505 as a reserve member of the armed forces or member of the National Guard. Leave under this subsection shall not exceed 15 calendar days per fiscal year and, to the extent that it is not used in a fiscal year, shall accumulate for use in the succeeding fiscal year until it totals 15 days at the beginning of a fiscal year. In the case of part-time employment, the rate at which leave accrues under this subsection shall be a percentage of the rate prescribed above which is determined by dividing 40 into the number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek of that employee during that fiscal year. The minimum charge for leave under this subsection is one hour, and additional charges are in multiples thereof.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m-1)</span> An employee who is a member of a reserve component of the armed forces, as described in 10 U.S.C. § 10101, or the National Guard, as described in 32 U.S.C. § 101 and who performs, for the purpose of providing military aid to enforce the law or for the purpose of providing assistance to civil authorities in the protection or saving of life, property, or the prevention of injury, under the following:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Federal service under 10 U.S.C. §§ 331, 332, 333, or 12406 or other provision of law, as applicable, or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Full-time military service for his or her state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States is entitled, during and because of such service, to leave without loss of, or reduction in, pay, leave to which he or her would be otherwise entitled, and credit for service or a performance rating. Leave granted by this paragraph shall not exceed 22 workdays in a calendar year.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m-2)</span> Upon the request of an employee, the period for which an employee is absent to perform service described by this subsection may be charged to the employee’s accrued annual leave or to compensatory time available to the employee instead of being charged as leave to which the employee is entitled under this subsection. The period of absence may not be charged to sick leave.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> If the basis for placing an employee on enforced leave pursuant to this section does not result in the taking of a disciplinary action pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-616.52.html">1-616.52</a> (or, in the case of an incumbent of a statutory position, the employee is not disciplined or removed in accordance with the provisions of the statute establishing the position), any annual leave or pay lost as a result of this administrative action shall be restored retroactively.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> For the purpose of this section:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The term “overtime pay” means pay for hours of service in excess of a statutory or other basic workweek or other basic unit of work time, as observed by the employing establishment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The term “year” means a period of 12 calendar months, or the equivalent thereof as specified by rules and regulations prescribed by the Mayor.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> In computing monetary compensation for disability or death on the basis of monthly pay, that pay is determined under this section.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The monthly pay at the time of injury is deemed one-twelfth of the average annual earnings of the employee at that time. When compensation is paid on a weekly basis, the weekly equivalent of the monthly pay is deemed one-fifty-second of the average annual earning. For so much of a period of total disability as does not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the beginning of compensable disability, the compensation, at the discretion of the Mayor, may be computed on the basis of the actual daily wage of the employee at the time of injury, in which event he or she may receive compensation for the days he or she would have worked but for the injury.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Average annual earnings are determined as follows:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the employee worked in the position in which he or she was employed at the time of his or her injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury and the employment was in a position for which an annual rate of pay:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Was fixed, the average annual earnings are the annual rate of pay; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Was not fixed, the average annual earnings are the product obtained by multiplying his or her daily wage for the particular employment or the average thereof, if the daily wage has fluctuated; by 300, if he or she was employed on the basis of a 6 day workweek; 280, if employed on the basis of a 5 1/2 day workweek; and 260, if employed on the basis of a 5 day workweek;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If the employee did not work in the position in which he or she was employed at the time of his or her injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury, but the position was one which would have afforded employment for substantially a whole year, the average annual earnings are a sum equal to the average annual earnings of an employee of the same class working substantially the whole immediately preceding year in the same or similar employment with the District government, as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If either of the foregoing methods of determining the average annual earnings cannot be applied reasonably and fairly, the average annual earnings are a sum that reasonably represents the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he or she was working at the time of the injury having regard to the previous earnings of the employee in District of Columbia government employment, and of other employees of the District of Columbia government in the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring location, other previous employment of the employee or other relevant factors. The average annual earnings may not be less than 150 times the average daily wage the employee earned in the employment during the days employed within 1 year immediately preceding his or her injury; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If the employee served without pay or a nominal pay, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection apply, as far as practicable, but the average earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-15 as provided in § 5332 of Title 5 of the United States Code or its equivalent as provided in subchapter XI of this chapter; provided that the average earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for DS-12, Step 10 or its equivalent in the collective bargaining unit for those employees hired after December 31, 1979, who make a claim for compensation for disability after December 29, 1994. If the average annual earnings cannot be determined reasonably and fairly in the manner otherwise provided by this section, the average annual earnings shall be determined at the reasonable value of the service performed but not in excess of $3,600 a year.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The value of subsistence and quarters, and of any other form of remuneration in kind for services if its value can be estimated in money and premium pay under § 5545(c)(1) of Title 5 of the United States Code, are included as part of the pay, but account is not taken of the following:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Overtime pay;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Additional pay or allowance authorized outside the District of Columbia government because of differential in cost of living or other special circumstances; or</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span> Before seeking to recover an overpayment or adjust benefits, the District government shall advise the individual in writing:</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> The term “without fault” means an individual is receiving benefits pursuant to a good faith dispute as to whether his or her medical condition entitles him or her to receive those benefits.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> Fixed living expenses such as food, housing, utilities, maintenance, insurance, and taxes;</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The determination of whether an individual was at fault regarding an overpayment shall depend upon the totality of circumstances surrounding the overpayment including the complexity of those circumstances and the individual’s capacity to realize that he or she is being overpaid. The government shall consider all pertinent circumstances including the individual’s age, intelligence, and any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations including any difficulty with the English language.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b-1)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Before the District government may seek to recover an overpayment or adjust benefits, the government must allow the individual the opportunity to present evidence to the government in writing or at a pre-recoupment hearing. The evidence must be presented or the hearing requested within 30 days of the date of the written notice of the overpayment. The 30-day requirement can be waived for good cause including mental or physical incapacity of the individual or lack of timely receipt of the notice of adjustment or recoupment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> An individual shall be required to provide relevant information and documentation to support his or her claim of severe financial hardship or that the individual needs substantially all of his or her current income to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses. Failure to submit the requested information within 30 days of the request shall result in denial of a request for a waiver and no further request for a waiver shall be considered until the requested information is furnished.</p>
