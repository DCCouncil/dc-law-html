                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Before any such insurance company, association, or order shall be licensed to do business in the District it shall file with the Commissioner a copy of its charter, declaration of organization, or articles of incorporation duly certified in accordance with the law by the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities [Commissioner of the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking], Insurance Commissioner, or other proper officers of the state, territory, or nation where the company, association, group, or organization was organized, a certificate setting forth that it is entitled to transact business and assume risks and issue policies of insurance therein and any other information required by the Commissioner; and a duly executed instrument appointing some suitable person in the District of Columbia, or not 10 miles beyond the territorial limits of the District of Columbia, as the agent for such company, upon whom all lawful process in any action or legal proceeding against it in the District may be served and shall register with the Commissioner the address of its principal office and the name and address of its agent for service of process in the District, including any changes in address.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Should said company refuse to appoint such agent, or should any person, after making reasonable efforts to do so (which efforts shall be documented), be unable to serve such agent, said legal process shall be served upon the Commissioner and shall be deemed service upon the company. The Commissioner may by regulation establish fees to be paid when legal process is served upon the Commissioner pursuant to this section. Whenever the Commissioner is served pursuant to this section, he or she shall forward forthwith such process by certified mail to the company named therein, and shall maintain a log showing when such process was served upon the Commissioner and when it was forwarded to the person named therein. The Commissioner shall provide to any person, upon request, the name and address of the agent for any company, or in the alternative, a list of all such agents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Any company, association, group, or organization that fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $500 a day for each violation. Civil fines, penalties, and fees may be imposed as alternative sanctions on any company, association, group, or organization that fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, or any rules or regulations issued pursuant to this section. Any company, association, group, or organization against which a fine, penalty, or fee has been imposed may, within 30 days after notice of the penalty is sent, contest the imposition or the amount of the civil fine, penalty, or fee. The hearing shall commence not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days from the date the request for the hearing is received by the Commissioner. The hearing shall be conducted according to the rules for contested cases enumerated in Title 26 (Insurance) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (26 DCMR).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The Commissioner shall maintain as confidential any documents or information received from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or insurance departments of other states which is confidential in such other jurisdictions. The Commissioner may share information, including otherwise confidential information, with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or insurance departments of other states so long as such other jurisdictions agree to maintain the same level of confidentiality as is available under District of Columbia law.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Every insurance company or association of whatever kind or character, not including fraternal beneficiary associations, shall, as required by law, pay to the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue, or to a depository designated by the Director, in lieu of all other taxes, except taxes upon real estate and any license fees provided for in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-804.html">31-804</a> [repealed] an amount equal to the following:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> In determining the gross amount of premiums to be taxed, there shall be excluded all premiums received from policies or contracts issued in connection with a pension, annuity, profit-sharing plan or individual retirement annuity qualified or exempt under §§ 401, 403, 404, 408, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or successor provisions, and all premiums returned to policyholders or annuitants during the preceding calendar year, except cash surrender values, all dividends that, during the year, have been paid in cash or applied in reduction of premiums or left to accumulate to the credit of policyholders or annuitants.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> One and seven tenths percent of the gross amount of premiums, assessments, and fees received during the preceding calendar year by every company or association other than life on contracts of insurance other than life for business done in the District, after deducting the amount returned upon canceled policies, certificates, and rejected applications.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the premium tax shall be paid on or before March 1 of the year following the calendar year for which the tax is due.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Each insurance company and association transacting business in the District whose District premium tax liability for the preceding calendar year was $1,000 or more shall remit on or before June 1, on a prepayment basis, an amount equal to one-half of the premium tax liability for the preceding calendar year.  The sums prepaid by a company or association under this subsection shall be allowed as credits against its premium tax liability for the calendar year during which the payments are made.  If a prepayment made under this subsection exceeds the annual premium tax liability, the excess shall be allowed as a credit against subsequent prepayment or tax liabilities.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Commissioner shall determine whether or not the tax remitted is correct.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> An insurer may offset an assessment made pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-5406.html">31-5406</a> (“Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act”), against its premium tax liability pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-5410.html">31-5410</a> to the extent of 10% of the amount of the assessment for each of the 10 calendar years following the year in which the assessment was paid.  If an insurer ceases doing business, all uncredited assessments may be credited against its premium tax liability for the year it ceases doing business.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Insurance premium taxes paid which were not paid under protest shall not be refunded if the refund claim is based upon an alleged error or mistake of law or erroneous interpretation of statute regarding the validity or legality of this section under the laws or constitution of the United States.</p>
