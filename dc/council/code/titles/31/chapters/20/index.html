                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The notification by the Commissioner to the insurer of an Adjusted RBC Report that indicates an event in paragraph (1) of this subsection, provided the insurer does not challenge the Adjusted RBC Report under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2007.html">31-2007</a>; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If, pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2007.html">31-2007</a>, an insurer challenges an Adjusted RBC Report that indicates the event in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the notification by the Commissioner to the insurer that the Commissioner has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer’s challenge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> In the event of a Company Action Level Event, the insurer shall prepare and submit to the Commissioner an RBC Plan which shall:</p>

The projections for both new and renewal business might include separate projections for each major line of business and separately identify each significant income, expense, and benefit component;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Identify the key assumptions impacting the insurer’s projections and the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Identify the quality of, and problems associated with, the insurer’s business, including, but not limited to, its assets, anticipated business growth and associated surplus strain, extraordinary exposure to risk, mix of business, and use of reinsurance, if any, in each case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The RBC Plan shall be submitted to the Commissioner within 45 days of the Company Action Level Event; or if the insurer challenges an Adjusted RBC Report pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2007.html">31-2007</a>, within 45 days after notification to the insurer that the Commissioner has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer’s challenge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Within 60 days after the submission by an insurer of an RBC Plan to the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall notify the insurer whether the RBC Plan shall be implemented or is, in the judgment of the Commissioner, unsatisfactory. If the Commissioner determines the RBC Plan is unsatisfactory, the notification to the insurer shall set forth the reasons for the determination, and may set forth proposed revisions which will render the RBC Plan satisfactory. Upon notification from the Commissioner, the insurer shall prepare a Revised RBC Plan, which may incorporate by reference any revisions proposed by the Commissioner, and shall submit the Revised RBC Plan to the Commissioner within 45 days after the notification from the Commissioner; or if the insurer challenges the notification from the Commissioner under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2007.html">31-2007</a>, within 45 days after a notification to the insurer that the Commissioner has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer’s challenge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> In the event of a notification by the Commissioner to an insurer that the insurer’s RBC Plan or Revised RBC Plan is unsatisfactory, the Commissioner may at the Commissioner’s discretion, subject to the insurer’s right to a hearing under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2007.html">31-2007</a>, specify in the notification that the notification constitutes a Regulatory Action Level Event as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2004.html">31-2004</a>.</p>
