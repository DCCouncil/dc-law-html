              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Any domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with 1 or more persons, may organize or acquire 1 or more subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business and their authority to do so shall not be limited by reason of the fact that they are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities permitted under the insurance laws of the District, a domestic insurer may also:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Invest, in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of 1 or more subsidiaries, amounts which do not exceed the lesser of 10% of the insurer’s assets or 50% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders; provided that after these investments, the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of these investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries shall be excluded, and there shall be included:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Total net monies or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary, including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of the subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> All amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus, of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities of 1 or more subsidiaries engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer, provided, that each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that the investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in or in paragraph (1) of this subsection or in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2502.18.html">31-2502.18</a> [repealed], or in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-4435.html">31-4435</a> [repealed] and 31-4442, applicable to the insurer. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “the total investment of the insurer” shall include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Any direct investment by the insurer in an asset; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The insurer’s proportionate share of any investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary’s investment by the percentage of the ownership of such a subsidiary; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> With the approval of the Mayor, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of 1 or more subsidiaries; provided, that after the investment the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall not be subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in the insurance laws of the District applicable to the investments of insurers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Whether any investment pursuant to subsection (b) of this section meets the applicable requirements is to be determined before the investment is made by calculating the applicable investment limitations as though the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the day they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.</p>

The Mayor shall determine those instances in which the party or parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest in an insurer will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. The information shall remain confidential until the conclusion of the transaction unless the Mayor, in the Mayor’s discretion, determines that confidential treatment will interfere with enforcement of this subchapter.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(11B)</span> An acknowledgement by the person required to file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section that the person and all subsidiaries within its control in the insurance holding company system will provide information to the Mayor upon request as necessary to evaluate enterprise risk to the insurer; and</p>

If any partner, member, or person is a corporation, or the person required to file the statement referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section is a corporation, the Mayor may require that the information called for by subsection (c)(1) through (12) of this section shall be given with respect to the corporation, each officer and director of the corporation, and each person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> If any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section is proposed to be made by means of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.), or in circumstances requiring the disclosure of similar information under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.), or under a state law requiring similar registration or disclosure, the person required to file the statement referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section may utilize the documents in furnishing the information called for by that statement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If the acquiring company proposes to acquire a domestic insurer which is not a nonprofit hospital service plan or medical service plan, the Mayor shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section unless, after a public hearing, the Mayor finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in the District or tend to create a monopoly. In applying the competitive standard in this sub-subparagraph:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The informational requirements of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-704.html">31-704</a>(c)(1) and the standards of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-704.html">31-704</a>(d)(2) shall apply;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the Mayor finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-704.html">31-704</a>(d)(3) exist; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(III)</span> The Mayor may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> The financial condition of any acquiring company is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iv)</span> The plans or proposals which the acquiring company has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer or are not in the public interest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(v)</span> The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(vi)</span> The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If an acquiring company proposes to acquire a domestic insurer which is a nonprofit hospital plan or medical service plan, the same procedure shall apply as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; provided, that the acquiring company shall have the burden of establishing that the proposed merger or acquisition of control does not result in the existence of any of the conditions set forth in sub-subparagraphs (i) through (vi) of subparagraph (A).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> The determination made by the Mayor as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not become effective until 90 days after the Mayor makes the determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be held within 120 days after the statement required by subsections (a) and (b) of this section is filed, and at least 20-days notice shall be given by the Mayor to the person filing the statement; provided, that the Mayor may extend the 120-day period if all parties consent to the extension. Not less than 7-days notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to any other persons designated by the Mayor.  The Mayor shall make a determination within 120 days after the conclusion of the hearing; provided, that the Mayor may extend this period if all parties consent to the extension. At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, and any party shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments, and shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than 3 days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Mayor may retain, at the acquiring person’s expense, any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the Mayor’s staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the Mayor in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control. For this purpose, the Mayor shall be exempt from the provisions of Unit A of Chapter 3 of Title 2.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section. A person shall file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners within 5 days of making the request for a public hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within 10 days of the receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend a hearing in person or by telecommunication.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The provisions of this section shall not apply to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Any transaction which is subject to the laws of the District dealing with the merger or consolidation of 2 or more insurers; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the Mayor by order shall exempt as:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> The following shall be violations of this section:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The effectuation, or any attempt to effectuate, an acquisition of control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the Mayor has given approval.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> Every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in the District who files a statement with the Mayor under this section shall be deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by such a person of the Mayor to be his or her true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of violations of this section. Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the Mayor and transmitted by registered or certified mail by the Mayor to the person at his or her last known address.</p>

            <h1>§ 31–704. Acquisitions involving insurers not otherwise covered.</h1>
            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> For the purposes of this section, the term:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> “Acquisition” means any agreement, arrangement, or activity the consummation of which results in a person acquiring, directly or indirectly, the control of another person, and includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance, and mergers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> “Involved insurer” means an insurer that either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> This section shall not apply to the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Repealed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes as long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause, or attempt to cause, the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in the District. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-701.html">31-701</a>(2), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the Commissioner of Insurance or other appropriate official of the insurer’s state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary Commissioner to the Mayor;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if preacquisition notification is filed with the Mayor in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition. This preacquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other subparagraph of paragraph (2) of this subsection;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The acquisition of already affiliated persons;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span><span class="level-num">(i)</span> An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed 5% of the total market;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> There would be no increase in any market share; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(III)</span> In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed 12% of the total market, and the market share increases by more than 2% of the total market.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term “market” means direct written insurance premium in the District for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in the District;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary state insurance commissioner or other appropriate official affirmatively finds that the insurer is in failing condition, there is a lack of a feasible alternative to improving the condition, the public benefits of improving the insurer’s condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition, and these findings are communicated by the domiciliary state insurance commissioner or other appropriate official to the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An acquisition covered by subsection (b) of this section may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection (e) of this section unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification. The Mayor shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this subsection in the same manner as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-708.html">31-708</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The preacquisition notification shall be in the form and contain the information prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those markets which, under subsection (b)(2)(E) of this section, cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section. The Mayor may require any additional material and information the Mayor deems necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of subsection (d) of this section. The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in the District accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt by the Mayor of a preacquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the 30th day after the date of the receipt or termination of the waiting period by the Mayor. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the Mayor, on a one-time basis, may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the 30th day after receipt of the additional information by the Mayor or termination of the waiting period by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Mayor may enter an order under subsection (e)(1) of this section with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be to lessen substantially competition in any line of insurance in the District, or tend to create a monopoly therein, or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Mayor shall consider the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Any acquisition covered under subsection (b) of this section involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards if the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:</p>
                <p>
                  <table>Insurer AInsurer B4%4% or more10%2% or more15%1% or more</table>
                </p>
                <p>or, if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market:</p>
                <p>
                  <table>Insurer AInsurer B5%5% or more10%4% or more15%3% or more19%1% or more.</table>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the 2 largest to the 8 largest, has increased by 7% or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year 5 to 10 years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under subsection (b) of this section involving 2 or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (1) of this subsection if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> Another involved insurer’s market is 2% or more.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> For the purposes of this paragraph, the term:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> “Insurer” includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership, or control.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> “Market” means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the Mayor shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, the line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in the District, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Mayor may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the following: market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market.</p>
                <p>A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the 4 largest insurers is 75% or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than 2 insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the 2 columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in paragraph (1) of this subsection. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be Insurer A.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> An order may not be entered under subsection (e)(1) through (4) of this section if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that feasibly cannot be achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from these economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of this increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the Mayor may enter an order:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in the District with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> An order under this subsection shall not be entered unless:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> There is a hearing;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Notice of the hearing is issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than 15 days prior to the hearing; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The hearing is concluded and the order is issued no later than 60 days after the end of the waiting period. Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the Mayor setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> An order entered under this subsection shall not become final earlier than 30 days after it is issued, during which time the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon such a plan or other information, the Mayor shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the standards of this section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> An order pursuant to this subsection shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the Mayor under paragraph (1) of this subsection while such an order is in effect may, after notice and hearing and upon order of the Mayor, be subject, at the discretion of the Mayor, to any one or more of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A monetary administrative penalty of not more than $10,000 for every day of violation; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Suspension or revocation of the person’s license.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any filing requirement, shall be subject to an administrative fine of not more than $50,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Sections 31-709(b) and (c) and 31-711 do not apply to acquisitions covered under subsection (b) of this section.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Every insurer which is authorized to do business in the District and which is a member of an insurance holding company system shall register with the Mayor, except a foreign insurer subject to registration requirements and standards adopted by statute or regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile which are substantially similar to those contained in the following provisions of this subchapter:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any insurer which is subject to registration under this section shall register within 15 days after it becomes subject to registration, and annually thereafter by April 30 of each year, unless the Mayor for good cause shown extends the time for registration, and then within the extended time. The Mayor may require any insurer authorized to do business in the District which is a member of a holding company system, and which is not subject to registration under this section, to furnish a copy of the registration statement, the summary specified in subsection (c) of this section or other information filed by the insurance company with the insurance regulatory authority of domiciliary jurisdiction.</p>

Financial statements may include annual audited financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, approved May 27, 1933 (48 Stat. 74; 15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, approved June 6, 1934 (48 Stat. 881; 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.).

The notice for amendments or modifications shall include the reasons for the change and the financial impact on the domestic insurer. Informal notice shall be reported to the Mayor within 30 days after termination of a previously filed agreement for determination of the type of filing required, if any:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans, or extensions of credit, guarantees, or investments provided the transactions are equal to or exceed:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> All reinsurance pooling agreements; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer’s liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer’s liabilities in any of the next 3 years, equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders, as of the 31st day of December next preceding, including those agreements that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a non-affiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and non-affiliate that any portion of the assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> All management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation agreements, guarantees, and all cost-sharing arrangements; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> Any material transactions, specified by regulation, which the Mayor determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer’s policyholders.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Nothing contained in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the Mayor determines that any separate transactions were entered into over any 12-month period for that purpose, the Mayor may exercise authority provided under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-710.html">31-710</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The Mayor, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The Mayor shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10% of such corporation’s voting securities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Thirty days after the Mayor has received notice of the declaration and has not within this period disapproved the payment; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The Mayor shall have approved the payment within the 30-day period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of 10% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding, or the net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the 31st day of December next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous 2 calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the Mayor’s approval, and such a declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until the Mayor has approved the payment of such a dividend or distribution, or the Mayor has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period referred to above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this subchapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with 1 or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Not less than 1/3 of the directors of a domestic insurer and not less than 1/3 of the members of each committee of the board of directors of any domestic insurer shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or such an entity. At least 1 such person must be included in any quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors or any committee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish 1 or more committees comprised solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer, and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity. The committee or committees shall have responsibilities of nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer, and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection shall not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer is an insurer, a mutual insurance holding company, or a publicly held corporation that has a board of directors and committees that meet the requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> An insurer may make application to the Mayor for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection, if the insurer’s annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and Federal Flood Program, is less than $300 million. An insurer may also make application to the Commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection based upon unique circumstances. The Mayor may consider various factors, including the type of business entity, volume of business written, availability of qualified board members, and the ownership or organizational structure of the entity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> For purposes of this subchapter, in determining whether an insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The extent to which the insurer’s business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The number and size of risks insured in each line of business;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer’s insured risks;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The nature and extent of the insurer’s reinsurance program;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer’s investment portfolio;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer’s investment portfolio;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> The adequacy of the insurer’s reserves; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The Mayor may treat such an investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in his or her judgment such an investment so warrants.</p>
