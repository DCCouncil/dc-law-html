                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The controlled insurer may terminate the contract for cause, upon written notice to the controlling producer.

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The controlling producer shall render accounts to the controlled insurer detailing all material transactions, including information necessary to support all commissions, charges, and other fees received by, or owing to, the controlling producer.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The controlling producer shall remit all funds due under the terms of the contract to the controlled insurer on at least a monthly basis. The due date shall be fixed so that premiums or installments collected shall be remitted no later than 90 days after the effective date of any policy placed with the controlled insurer under this contract.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> All funds collected for the controlled insurer’s account shall be held by the controlling producer in a fiduciary capacity, in one or more appropriately identified bank accounts in banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, in accordance with applicable provisions of insurance law of the District of Columbia. Funds of a controlling producer not required to be licensed in the District of Columbia shall be maintained in compliance with the requirements of the controlling producer’s domiciliary jurisdiction.</p>

The controlling producer shall adhere to the standards, rules, procedures, rates, and conditions. The standards, rules, procedures, rates, and conditions shall be the same as those applicable to comparable business placed with the controlled insurer by a producer other than the controlling producer.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> The rates and terms of the controlling producer’s commissions, charges, or other fees and the purposes for those charges or fees shall be included.

For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (7) of this section, examples of “comparable business” include the same lines of insurance, same kinds of insurance, same kinds of risks, similar policy limits, and similar quality of business.</p>

In no event shall the commissions be paid until the adequacy of the controlled insurer’s reserves on remaining claims has been independently verified pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (6) of this section.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> The contract provides a limit on the controlling producer’s writings in relation to the controlled insurer’s surplus and total writings.
