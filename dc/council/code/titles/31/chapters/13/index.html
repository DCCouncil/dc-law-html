The court shall vacate the seizure order if the Commissioner fails to commence a formal proceeding under this chapter after having had a reasonable opportunity to do so.

              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>The Commissioner may apply by petition to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for an order authorizing him or her to rehabilitate a domestic insurer or an alien insurer domiciled in the District based on any one or more of the following grounds:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The insurer is in such a condition that the further transaction of business would be hazardous financially to its policyholders, creditors, or the public.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> There is reasonable cause to believe that there has been embezzlement from the insurer, wrongful sequestration or diversion of the insurer’s assets, forgery or fraud affecting the insurer, or other illegal conduct in, by, or with respect to the insurer that if established would endanger assets in an amount threatening the solvency of the insurer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The insurer has failed to remove any person who in fact has executive authority in the insurer, whether an officer, manager, general agent, employee, or other person, if the person has been found after notice and hearing by the Commissioner to be dishonest or untrustworthy in a way affecting the insurer’s business.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Control of the insurer, whether by stock ownership or otherwise, and whether direct or indirect, is in a person or persons found after notice and hearing to be untrustworthy in any way that affects the insurer’s business.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Any person who in fact has executive authority in the insurer, whether an officer, manager, general agent, director or trustee, employee, or other person, has refused to be examined under oath by the Commissioner concerning its affairs, whether in the District or elsewhere, and after reasonable notice of the fact, the insurer has failed promptly and effectively to terminate its relationship with that person, or to prevent that person from influencing the insurer’s management.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> After demand by the Commissioner under this chapter, or any law authorizing the Commissioner to examine the operations of an insurer, the insurer has failed to promptly make available for examination any of its own property, books, accounts, documents, or other records, or those of any subsidiary or related company within the control of the insurer, or those of any person having executive authority in the insurer so far as they pertain to the insurer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Without first obtaining the written consent of the Commissioner, the insurer has transferred, or attempted to transfer, in a manner contrary to Chapter 7 of this title, substantially its entire property or business, or has entered into any transaction the effect of which is to merge, consolidate, or reinsure substantially its entire property or business in or with the property or business of any other person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> The insurer or its property has been or is the subject of an application for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, or sequestrator or similar fiduciary of the insurer or its property other than as authorized under the insurance laws of the District, and the appointment has been made or is imminent, and the appointment would deprive the courts of the District of Columbia of jurisdiction or might prejudice the orderly delinquency proceedings under this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> The insurer, within the previous 4 years, willfully violated its charter or articles of incorporation, its bylaws, any insurance law of the District, or any valid order of the Commissioner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> The insurer has failed to pay, within 60 days after due date, any obligation to any state or any subdivision or any judgment entered in any state, if the court in which the judgment was entered had jurisdiction over the subject matter, except that the nonpayment shall not be a ground until 60 days after any good faith effort by the insurer to contest the obligation has been terminated, whether it is before the Commissioner or in court, or the insurer has systematically attempted to compromise or renegotiate previously agreed settlements with its creditors on the ground that it is financially unable to pay its obligations in full.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(11)</span> The insurer has failed to file its annual report or other financial report required by statute within the time allowed by law, and, after written demand by the Commissioner, has failed to give an adequate explanation immediately.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(12)</span> The board of directors or the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, or a majority of those individuals entitled to the control of those entities specified in the insurance laws of the District, request or consent to rehabilitation under this chapter.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> An order to liquidate the business of a domestic insurer shall appoint the Commissioner and his or her successors in office liquidator and shall direct the liquidator to take possession of the assets of the insurer and to administer them under the general supervision of the court. The liquidator shall be vested by operation of law with the title to all of the property, contracts, and rights of action, and all of the books and records of the insurer ordered liquidated, wherever located, as of the entry of the final order of liquidation. The filing or recording of the order with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, or, in the case of real estate, with the recorder of deeds of the county where the property is located, shall impart the same notice as a deed, bill of sale, or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded with that recorder of deeds would have imparted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Upon issuance of the order, the rights and liabilities of any insurer and of its creditors, policyholders, shareholders, members, and all other persons interested in its estate shall become fixed as of the date of entry of the order of liquidation, except as provided in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1317.html">31-1317</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1335.html">31-1335</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> At the time of petitioning for an order of liquidation, or at any time thereafter, the Commissioner, after making appropriate findings of an insurer’s insolvency, may petition the court for a judicial declaration of insolvency. After providing notice and hearing it deems proper, the court may make the declaration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Any order issued under this section shall require financial reports to the court by the liquidator. Financial reports shall include, at a minimum, the assets and liabilities of the insurer and all funds received or disbursed by the liquidator during the current period.

Such a plan shall provide for the continued performance and payment of policy claims obligations in the normal course of events, notwithstanding the grounds alleged in support of the order of liquidation including the ground of insolvency. In the event the defendant company’s financial condition will not, in the judgment of the Commissioner, support the full performance of all policy claims obligations during the appeal pendency period, the plan may prefer the claims of certain policyholders and claimants over creditors and interested parties as well as other policyholders and claimants, as the Commissioner finds to be fair and equitable considering the relative circumstances of the policyholders and claimants. The court shall examine the plan submitted by the Commissioner, and, if it finds the plan to be in the best interests of the parties, the court shall approve the plan. No action shall lie against the Commissioner or any of his deputies, agents, clerks, assistants, or attorneys by any party based on preference in an appeal pendency plan approved by the court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The appeal pendency plan shall not supersede or affect the obligations of any insurance guaranty association.</p>

Further, in the event an order of liquidation is set aside upon any appeal, the company shall not be released from delinquency proceedings unless and until all funds advanced by any guaranty association, including reasonable administrative expenses in connection therewith relating to obligations of the company, shall be repaid in full, together with interest at the judgment rate of interest, or unless an arrangement for repayment has been made with the consent of all applicable guaranty associations.</p>

            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A preference is a transfer of any of the property of an insurer to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by the insurer within 1 year before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter, the effect of which transfer may be to enable the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of this debt than another creditor of the same class would receive. If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already subject to a rehabilitation order, then the transfers shall be deemed preferences if made or suffered within 1 year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation, or within 2 years before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any preference may be avoided by the liquidator if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The transfer was made within 4 months before the filing of the petition;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The creditor receiving it or to be benefitted thereby or his agent acting with reference thereto had, at the time when the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The creditor receiving it was an officer, or any employee or attorney or other person who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the insurer to an officer whether or not he or she held such a position, or any shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than 5% of any class of any equity security issued by the insurer, or any other person, firm, corporation, association, or aggregation of persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm’s length.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property or, if it has been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted the property, except where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, he or she shall have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by him or her. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or title to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event the lien or title shall pass to the liquidator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A transfer of property other than real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to the rights of the transferee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed to be perfected if there are available means by which a legal lien could be created.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed to be made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the ordinary course of the proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, upon, or after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens which under applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings could become superior to the rights of a transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee within the meaning of subsection (b) of this section, if the consequences would follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. Such a lien could not, however, become superior and such a purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of subsection (b) of this section through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of such a lien or subsequent to such a purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any further judicial action or ruling.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under subsection (b) of this section to be made or suffered after the transfer because of delay in perfecting it does not thereby become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers’ rights are performed within 21 days or any period expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if such a loan is actually made, or a transfer which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If any lien deemed voidable under subsection (a)(2) of this section has been dissolved by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the filing of a petition under this chapter which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under subsections (a) and (e) of this section shall be discharged from the lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on due notice order such a lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that such a conveyance be executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall have summary jurisdiction of any proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under this section. Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including the obligee of a releasing bond or other like obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnified or than the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator, within a reasonable time as the court shall fix.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The liability of the surety under a releasing bond or other like obligation shall be discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying lien nullified and avoided by the liquidator, or, where the property is retained under subsection (g) of this section, to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If a creditor has been preferred, and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further credit without security of any kind, for property which becomes a part of the insurer’s estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the preference which would otherwise be recoverable from him.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> If an insurer, directly or indirectly, within 4 months before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter, or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to liquidate it, pays money or transfers property to an attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered, the transactions may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of the liquidator and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the liquidator for the benefit of the estate provided that where the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer or an affiliate payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney-at-law for services rendered or to be rendered shall be governed by the provisions of subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Every officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or any other person acting on behalf of the insurer who knowingly participates in giving any preference when he or she has reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or is about to become insolvent at the time of the preference shall be personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference. It is permissible to infer that there is a reasonable cause to so believe if the transfer was made within 4 months before the date of filing of this successful petition for liquidation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Every person receiving any property from the insurer or the benefit thereof as a preference voidable under subsection (a) of this section shall be personally liable therefor and shall be bound to account to the liquidator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any other claim by the liquidator against any person.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Whenever any third party asserts a cause of action against an insured of an insurer in liquidation, the third party may file a claim with the liquidator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Whether or not the third party files a claim, the insured may file a claim on his or her own behalf in the liquidation. If the insured fails to file a claim by the date for filing claims specified in the order of liquidation or within 60 days after mailing of the notice required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1320.html">31-1320</a>, whichever is later, he or she is an unexcused late filer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The liquidator shall make his or her recommendations to the court under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1340.html">31-1340</a> for the allowance of an insured’s claim under subsection (b) of this section after consideration of the probable outcome of any pending action against the insured on which the claim is based, the probable damages recoverable in the action, and the probable costs and expenses of defense. After allowance by the court, the liquidator shall withhold any dividends payable on the claim pending the outcome of litigation and negotiation with the insured. Whenever it seems appropriate, he or she shall reconsider the claim on the basis of additional information and amend his or her recommendations to the court. The insured shall be afforded the same notice and opportunity to be heard on all changes in the recommendation as in its initial determination. The court may amend its allowance as it thinks appropriate. As claims against the insured are settled or barred, the insured shall be paid from the amount withheld the same percentage dividend as was paid on other claims of like property, based on the lesser of the amount actually recovered from the insured by action, or paid by agreement, plus the reasonable costs and expense of defense, or the amount allowed on the claims by the court. After all claims are settled or barred, any sum remaining from the amount withheld shall revert to the undistributed assets of the insurer. Delay in final payment under this subsection shall not be a reason for unreasonable delay of final distribution and discharge of the liquidator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If several claims founded upon one policy are filed, whether by third parties or as claims by the insured under this section, and the aggregate allowed amount of the claims to which the same limit of liability in the policy is applicable exceeds that limit, each claim as allowed shall be reduced in the same proportion so that the total equals the policy limit. Claims by the insured shall be evaluated as in subsection (c) of this section. If any insured’s claim is subsequently reduced under subsection (c) of this section, the amount thus freed shall be apportioned ratably among the claims which have been reduced under this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> No claim may be presented under this section if it is, or may be, covered by any guaranty association or foreign guaranty association.</p>
