                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The managing general agent will render accounts to the insurer detailing all transactions and remit all funds due under the contract to the insurer on not less than a monthly basis.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Separate records of business written by the managing general agent will be maintained. The insurer shall have access and right to copy all accounts and records related to its business in a form usable by the insurer, and the Mayor shall have access to all books, bank accounts, and records of the managing general agent in a form usable to the Mayor.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> All claims must be reported to the company within 48 hours of receipt.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A copy of the claim file will be sent to the insurer at its request or as soon as it becomes known that the claim:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> All claim files will be the joint property of the insurer and managing general agent. Upon an order of liquidation of the insurer, however, these files shall become the sole property of the insurer or its estate; the managing general agent shall have reasonable access to and the right to copy the files on a timely basis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Any settlement authority granted to the managing general agent may be terminated for cause upon the insurer’s written notice to the managing general agent or upon the termination of the contract. The insurer may suspend the settlement authority during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause for termination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> Where electronic claims files are in existence, the contract must address the timely transmission of the data.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> If the contract provides for a sharing of interim profits by the managing general agent, and the managing general agent has the authority to determine the amount of the interim profits by establishing loss reserves or controlling claim payments, or in any other manner, interim profits will not be paid to the managing general agent until 1 year after they are earned for property insurance business and 5 years after they are earned on casualty business and not until the profits have been verified pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1504.html">31-1504</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(11)</span> The managing general agent shall not:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Bind reinsurance or retrocessions on behalf of the insurer, except that the managing general agent may bind facultative reinsurance contracts pursuant to obligatory facultative agreements if the contract with the insurer contains reinsurance underwriting guidelines including, for both reinsurance assumed and ceded, a list of reinsurers with which such automatic agreements are in effect, the coverages and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured, and commission schedules;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Commit the insurer to participate in insurance or reinsurance syndicates;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Appoint any producer without assuring that the producer is lawfully licensed to transact the type of insurance for which he is appointed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Without prior approval of the insurer, pay or commit the insurer to pay a claim over a specified amount, net of reinsurance, which shall not exceed 1% of the insurer’s policyholder’s surplus as of December 31 of the last completed calendar year;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> Collect any payment from a reinsurer or commit the insurer to any claim settlement with a reinsurer without prior approval of the insurer. If prior approval is given, a report must be promptly forwarded to the insurer;</p>
