                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Such a deficiency shall be deemed an impairment, and failure to correct the impairment in the prescribed time shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the certificate of authority or for placing the health maintenance organization in conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The existence of an impairment, however, shall not prevent the issuance or renewal of a certificate, agreement, or contract when the enrollee exercises an option granted under the plan to obtain a new, renewed, or converted coverage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> A certificate of authority shall be suspended or revoked, or an application or a certificate of authority denied, or an administrative penalty imposed only after compliance with the requirements of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority, the denial of an application, or the imposition of an administrative penalty pursuant to this section shall be by written order and shall be sent to the health maintenance organization or applicant by certified or registered mail. The written order shall state the grounds, charges, or conduct on which suspension, revocation, or denial or administrative penalty is based. A health maintenance organization or applicant may in writing request a hearing within 30 days from the date of mailing of the order. If no written request is made, such order shall be final upon the expiration of the 30 days.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If a health maintenance organization or applicant requests a hearing pursuant to this section, the Commissioner shall issue a written notice of hearing and send it to the health maintenance organization or applicant by certified or registered mail.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A specific time for the hearing, which may not be less than 20 days nor more than 30 days after mailing of the notice of hearing; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A specific place for the hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If a hearing is requested, the Commissioner or his designated representative shall be in attendance and shall participate in the proceedings. The recommendations and findings of the Commissioner in respect to matters relating to the quality of health care services provided in connection with any decision regarding denial, suspension, or revocation of a certificate of authority shall be conclusive and binding upon the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> After such a hearing, or upon failure of the health maintenance organization to appear at the hearing, the Commissioner shall take whatever action he or she deems necessary based on written findings and shall mail his or her decision to the health maintenance organization or applicant. The action of the Commissioner shall be subject to review under subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The provisions of the DCAPA shall apply to proceedings under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> When the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization shall not, during the period of such suspension, enroll any additional enrollees except newborn children, other newly acquired dependents of existing enrollees, or other newly eligible individuals, and shall not engage in any advertising or solicitation whatsoever.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> When the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is revoked, such organization shall proceed, immediately following the effective date of the order or revocation, to wind up its affairs within the District, and shall conduct no further business within the District except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of such organization within the District. It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation whatsoever within the District. The Commissioner may, by written order, permit such further operation of the organization as the Commissioner may find to be in the best interest of enrollees, to the end that enrollees will be afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage.</p>
