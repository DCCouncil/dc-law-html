                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in Chapter 7 of this title, or this chapter, a transaction ongoing as of April 9, 1997, which would otherwise be subject to the notice requirements of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-706.html">31-706</a>(a), shall be filed with the Mayor for approval no later than 90 days after April 9, 1997, only if the transaction involves more than 3% of the amount of admitted assets or more than 20% of the amount of surplus of the corporation as of the 31st day of the previous December, whichever amount is less. Failure of the Mayor to act within 60 days after such a filing shall constitute approval of the transaction.
