                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span><span class="level-heading"> Findings. —</span> The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Motorists, motor vehicle passengers, and pedestrians in the District are not adequately protected, by current law and practice, from the consequences of motor vehicle accidents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If a person suffers personal injuries because of an accident involving a motor vehicle in the District, he or she is unlikely to recover the amount of his or her actual losses because:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Approximately 50% of the victims do not satisfy the prerequisites to compensation under the present law;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Approximately 40% of the operators in the District do not maintain any motor vehicle insurance or have other financial resources sufficient to pay losses;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The average motor vehicle insurance policy in the District will pay only up to $10,000 for the personal injuries of any 1 victim, a sum that is insufficient to compensate adequately a victim with serious injuries; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Satisfaction of the prerequisites to compensation under the present law is time-consuming and expensive to policyholders because a victim must establish that the accident was the fault of another person; that the person injured was free from contributory fault; and that the injuries suffered were the natural and probable consequences of the accident.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Far greater protection to victims of motor vehicle accidents is available at a lower price than that afforded for coverage currently available.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The purchase of this better insurance protection should be compulsory because of the great potential of a motor vehicle to cause personal injury.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-heading"> Purpose. —</span> It is the purpose of this chapter to provide adequate protection for victims who are injured in the District or who are injured while riding in motor vehicles registered or operated in the District.</p>

The Order provided for the organization of the Department, abolished the previously existing Department of Insurance, and provided that all functions and positions of the previous Department would be transferred to the new Department of Insurance, including the duties, powers, and authorities of all officers and employees; and that all personnel, property, records and unexpended balances relating to the functions and positions transferred would also be transferred to the new Department. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. The functions of the Superintendent of Insurance were transferred to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983. Pursuant to the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-268.html">D.C. Law 11-268</a>, the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation was established and the duties of the Superintendent of Insurance and the Insurance Administration were assumed by the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities, and the Insurance Administration in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs was abolished.</p>

                <p>“(2)(A) The Director shall suspend or revoke the license, reciprocity sticker, or registration certificate issued to the owner or operator of a motor vehicle who has been convicted of a violation of this chapter, or who knowingly operates or knowingly permits the operation of an uninsured motor vehicle, or who falsely certifies to the Director that a motor vehicle is an insured motor vehicle, or who knowingly provides the Director with false or inaccurate information as requested by the Director pursuant to this chapter.</p>
                <p>“(i) Whenever a license, reciprocity sticker, or registration certificate has been revoked or suspended under the provisions of this subsection the reasons therefor shall be set forth in the order of revocation or suspension. The order shall take effect 5 days after service or notice on the person whose license, reciprocity sticker, or registration certificate is revoked or suspended unless the person shall have filed with the Director, within the 5-day period, written application for a hearing; provided, that application to the Director for a hearing shall not operate as a stay of the order of the Director when the order has been issued revoking or suspending a reciprocity sticker or registration certificate. The hearing by the Director shall only cover the issues of whether a policy motor vehicle of insurance has been issued to the person and had been in effect on the day the order of revocation or suspension was issued and whether the person provided the Director with false or inaccurate information.</p>
                <p>“(ii) If, following the hearing provided for in this subsection, the Director shall sustain the order of revocation or suspension, the order shall become effective immediately.</p>
                <p>“(iii) Where the registration certificate, license, or reciprocity sticker has been revoked, no new registration certificate, license, or reciprocity sticker shall be issued to the person for 6 months after the effective date of the order of revocation; provided, that no new registration certificate or reciprocity sticker shall be issued to the person until the motor vehicle is an insured motor vehicle.”</p>
                <p>“(4)(A) The reasonable costs incurred by the District government in administering and enforcing the requirements of this section and § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2413.html">31-2413</a> shall be paid from the Administration Fund.”</p>
