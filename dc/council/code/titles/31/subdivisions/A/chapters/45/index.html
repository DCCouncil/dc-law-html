                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Department of Insurance abolished: The Department of Insurance, including the Superintendent, was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 43, dated June 23, 1953, as amended, established, under the direction and control of a Commissioner, a Department of Insurance headed by a Superintendent. The Order provided for the organization of the Department, abolished the previously existing Department of Insurance, and provided that all functions and positions of the previous Department would be transferred to the new Department of Insurance, including the duties, powers, and authorities of all officers and employees; and that all personnel, property, records and unexpended balances relating to the functions and positions transferred would also be transferred to the new Department. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. The functions of the Superintendent of Insurance were transferred to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983. Pursuant to the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-268.html">D.C. Law 11-268</a>, the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation was established and the duties of the Superintendent of Insurance and the Insurance Administration were assumed by the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities, and the Insurance Administration in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs was abolished.</p>

                <p>The directors of an alien company may appoint citizens or corporations of the United States, approved by the Commissioner, as its trustees to hold funds and assets in trust for the benefit of the policyholders and creditors of the company in the United States. A certified copy of the record of such appointment and of the deed of trust shall be filed with the Commissioner, who may examine such trustees and any officers and agents, books, and papers of the company in the same manner as he may examine officers, agents, books, papers, and affairs of insurance companies. The funds and assets so held by such trustees shall, with the deposits otherwise made by the company and the funds and assets held by the company in the United States for the benefit of its policyholders and creditors in the United States, constitute the assets of the company for the purpose of making its financial statements required by this subdivision.</p>
