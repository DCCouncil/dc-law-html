                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The Commissioner shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (hereinafter called reserves) for all outstanding life insurance policies and annuity and pure endowment contracts of every life insurance company doing business in the District, except that in the case of an alien company such valuation shall be limited to its insurance transactions in the United States, and may certify the amount of any such reserves, specifying the mortality table or tables, rate or rates of interest and methods (net level premium method or other) used in the calculation of such reserves. All such valuations made by him or by his authority shall be made upon the net premium basis. In calculating such reserves, he may use group methods and approximate averages for fractions of a year or otherwise. In lieu of the valuation of the reserves herein required of any foreign or alien company, he may accept any valuation made, or caused to be made, by the insurance supervisory official of any state or other jurisdiction when such valuation complies with the minimum standard herein provided and if the official of such state or jurisdiction accepts as sufficient and valid for all legal purposes the certificate of valuation of the Commissioner when such certificate states the valuation to have been made in a specified manner according to which the aggregate reserves would be at least as large as if they had been computed in the manner prescribed by the law of that state or jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Any such company which at any time shall have adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to a minimum standard herein provided may, with the approval of the Commissioner, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum herein provided.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> This subsection shall apply to only those policies and contracts issued prior to the operative date of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-4705.02.html">31-4705.02</a> (the standard nonforfeiture law).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The legal minimum standard for the valuation of life insurance contracts issued before January 1, 1935, shall be the method and basis of valuation heretofore applied by the Commissioner in the valuation of such contracts, and for life insurance contracts issued on and after said date shall be the 1-year preliminary term method of valuation, except as hereinafter modified, on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mortality with interest at 3 1/2% per annum; provided, that any life company may, at its option, value its insurance contracts issued on and after January 1, 1935, in accordance with their terms on the basis of the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality with interest not higher than 3 1/2% per annum by the level net premium method or by the modified preliminary term method hereinafter described.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> If the premium charged for term insurance under a limited payment life preliminary term policy providing for the payment of all premiums thereon in less than 20 years from date of the policy, or under an endowment preliminary term policy, exceeds that charged for like insurance under 20-payment life preliminary term policies of the same company, the reserve thereon at the end of the year, including the 1st, shall not be less than the reserve on a 20-payment life preliminary term policy issued in the same year and at the same age, together with an amount which shall be equivalent to the accumulation of a net level premium sufficient to provide for a pure endowment at the end of the premium payment period, equal to the difference between the value at the end of such period of such a 20-payment life preliminary term policy and the full net level premium reserve at such time of such a limited payment life or endowment policy. The premium payment period is the period during which premiums are concurrently payable under such 20-payment life preliminary term policy and such limited payment life or endowment policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> Policies issued on the preliminary term method shall contain a clause specifying that the reserve thereof shall be computed in accordance with modified preliminary term method of valuation provided for herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of this section for group annuity and pure endowment contracts, the legal minimum standard for the valuation of annuities issued on and after January 1, 1935, shall be McClintock’s Table of Mortality Among Annuitants, with interest at 4% per annum, but annuities deferred 10 or more years and written in connection with life insurance shall be valued on the same basis as that used in computing the consideration or premium therefor, or upon any higher standard at the option of the company.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> The legal minimum standard for the valuation of industrial policies issued after January 1, 1935, shall be the American Experience Table of Mortality with interest at 3 1/2% per annum; provided, that any life company may voluntarily value its industrial policies on the basis of the standard industrial mortality table or the substandard industrial mortality table by the level net premium method or in accordance with their terms by the modified preliminary term method hereinbefore described.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(7)">(7)</span> The Commissioner may vary the standards of interest and mortality in the case of alien companies as to contracts issued by such companies in countries other than the United States, and in particular cases of invalid lives and other extra hazards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)">(8)</span> Reserves for all such policies and contracts may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by this subsection.</p>

                <p>Department of Insurance abolished: The Department of Insurance, including the Superintendent, was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 43, dated June 23, 1953, as amended, established, under the direction and control of a Commissioner, a Department of Insurance headed by a Superintendent. The Order provided for the organization of the Department, abolished the previously existing Department of Insurance, and provided that all functions and positions of the previous Department would be transferred to the new Department of Insurance, including the duties, powers, and authorities of all officers and employees; and that all personnel, property, records and unexpended balances relating to the functions and positions transferred would also be transferred to the new Department. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. The functions of the Superintendent of Insurance were transferred to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983. Pursuant to the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-268.html">D.C. Law 11-268</a>, the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation was established and the duties of the Superintendent of Insurance and the Insurance Administration were assumed by the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities, and the Insurance Administration in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs was abolished.</p>
                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), and (i) of this section, additional benefits payable: (1) in the event of total and permanent disability; (2) as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits; or (3) as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits; and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless such additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.</p>

If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this section for such company shall be 2 years after October 13, 1978.</p>

Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(276) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
