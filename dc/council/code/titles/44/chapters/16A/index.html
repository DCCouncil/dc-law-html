A release or modification may not allow a fund to be used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose of the institution.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The restriction has become impracticable or wasteful;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The institution shall notify the Attorney General for the District of Columbia of the application, and the Attorney General for the District of Columbia shall be given an opportunity to be heard.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> More than 20 years have elapsed since the fund was established; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> The institution uses the property in a manner consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> The dollar amount shall be adjusted as of January 1st of each year if the cumulative percentage of change in the Index, from the base year or from a later year that was the basis of an adjustment of this amount pursuant to this subsection, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, is in excess of 10%.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> The amount of any adjustment shall be rounded to the nearest $5,000.</p>
