                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The philosophy of assisted living emphasizes personal dignity, autonomy, independence, privacy, and freedom of choice. Further, the services and physical environment of an assisted living residence should enhance a person’s ability to age in place in a homelike setting by increasing or decreasing the amount of assistance in accordance with the individual’s changing needs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> This chapter shall be interpreted in accordance with the following philosophy of care:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An assisted living residence is a program which combines housing, health, and supportive services for the support of residents aging in place. The function of an assisted living residence is to provide or coordinate personalized assistance through activities of daily living, recreational activities, 24-hour supervision, and provision or coordination of health services and instrumental activities of daily living as needed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The design of services and environment should acknowledge that a significant number of residents may have some form of cognitive impairment. Services and environment should offer a balance between choice and safety in the least restrictive setting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Both the program and environment should support resident dignity, privacy, independence, individuality, freedom of choice, decision making, spirituality, and involvement of family and friends.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Residents should be supported to age in place by minimizing the need to move through reasonable accommodation and, when necessary, through coordination and use of home health agencies, hospice, rehabilitation agencies, and other licensed healthcare providers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Quality, affordable assisted living residence care should be accessible to all individuals residing in the District regardless of income.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A shared responsibility agreements represents a tool for ALRs to recognize an individual resident’s right to autonomy by respecting his or her right to make individual decisions regarding lifestyle, personal behavior, and ISPs. In some cases, a resident’s decision may involve increased risk of personal harm and therefore potentially increase the risk of liability by the ALR absent an agreement between the resident and ALR concerning such decisions or actions. In such instances the ALR shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Explain to the resident, or surrogate, why the decision or action may  pose risks and suggest alternatives to the resident; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Discuss with the resident, or surrogate, how the ALR might mitigate  potential risks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If, after consultation with the ALR as required by subsection (b) of this section, a resident decides to pursue a course of action, such as refusal of services, that may involve increased risk of personal harm and conflict with the ALR’s usual responsibilities, the ALR shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Describe to the resident the action or range of actions subject to  negotiation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Negotiate a shared responsibility agreement, with the resident as a full  partner, acceptable to the resident and the ALR that meets all reasonable  requirements implicated.
