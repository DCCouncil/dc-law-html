                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Whenever disagreements arise as to lifestyle, personal behavior, safety, and service plans the ALR staff, resident or surrogate, and other relevant service providers shall attempt to develop a shared responsibility agreement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A shared responsibility agreements represents a tool for ALRs to recognize an individual resident’s right to autonomy by respecting his or her right to make individual decisions regarding lifestyle, personal behavior, and ISPs. In some cases, a resident’s decision may involve increased risk of personal harm and therefore potentially increase the risk of liability by the ALR absent an agreement between the resident and ALR concerning such decisions or actions. In such instances the ALR shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Explain to the resident, or surrogate, why the decision or action may  pose risks and suggest alternatives to the resident; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Discuss with the resident, or surrogate, how the ALR might mitigate  potential risks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If, after consultation with the ALR as required by subsection (b) of this section, a resident decides to pursue a course of action, such as refusal of services, that may involve increased risk of personal harm and conflict with the ALR’s usual responsibilities, the ALR shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Describe to the resident the action or range of actions subject to  negotiation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Negotiate a shared responsibility agreement, with the resident as a full  partner, acceptable to the resident and the ALR that meets all reasonable  requirements implicated. The shared responsibility agreement shall be signed  by the resident or surrogate and the ALR.</p>

              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> When a resident wishes to be discharged from an ALR, the resident or surrogate shall give 30 days written notice to the ALR.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> When a sudden, unexpected, and life-threatening medical emergency arises necessitating the immediate transfer of the resident to an acute care facility, the ALR shall immediately notify the surrogate and the resident’s healthcare provider of the transfer. The ALR shall provide the surrogate and healthcare provider with information concerning cause of the transfer and the name and location of the acute care facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> After a resident is transferred pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, his or her return to the ALR shall be determined by the renegotiation of the ISP with the resident or surrogate, the resident’s healthcare provider, and the ALR. If, in renegotiating the ISP, the interested parties determine that the resident can no longer safely reside at the ALR, discharge planning shall take place in consultation with the resident or surrogate, the resident’s healthcare provider, and the ALR. Under these circumstances the ALR shall waive the 30 day notice requirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Before a resident may be discharged on an involuntary basis, the ALR shall provide 30 days written notice to the resident and surrogate of the planned discharge, and make arrangements for the discharge in consultation with the resident, the surrogate, and the healthcare provider. Any involuntary discharge shall conform to the notice and process established in subchapter III of Chapter 10 of this title.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Although an ALR shall make every effort to avoid discharge, grounds for involuntary discharge may include the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Failure to pay all fees and costs as specified in the contract; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Inability of the ALR to meet the care needs of the resident as provided  in the ISP.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> An involuntary discharge shall be canceled upon the occurrence of one of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The payment of all monies owed at any time prior to discharge; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The negotiation of a new ISP.</p>
