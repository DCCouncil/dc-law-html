                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The person has a duty, imposed by statute or regulation, to investigate whether an adverse claim exists, and the investigation so required would establish the existence of the adverse claim.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Having knowledge that a financial asset or interest therein is or has been transferred by a representative imposes no duty of inquiry into the rightfulness of a transaction and is not notice of an adverse claim. However, a person who knows that a representative has transferred a financial asset or interest therein in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> An act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a security certificate or sets a date on or after which the certificate is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not itself constitute notice of an adverse claim except in the case of a transfer more than:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> One year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange; or</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> A purchaser of a certificated security has notice of an adverse claim if the security certificate:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Whether in bearer or registered form, has been indorsed “for collection” or “for surrender” or for some other purpose not involving transfer; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Is in bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, but the mere writing of a name on the certificate is not such a statement.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Filing of a financing statement under Article 9 is not notice of an adverse claim to a financial asset.</p>
