                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> An “investment company security” is a security. The term “investment company security” means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this article and not by Article 3, even though it also meets the requirements of that article. However, a negotiable instrument governed by Article 3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> A commodity contract, as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:9-102.html">28:9-102</a>(a)(15), is not a security or a financial asset.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> One year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange; or</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the securities intermediary’s jurisdiction for purposes of this part or this article, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary’s jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If paragraph (1) does not apply and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder expressly provides that the agreement is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary’s jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If neither paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary’s jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If none of the preceding paragraphs of this subsection applies, the securities intermediary’s jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the entitlement holder’s account is located.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> If none of the preceding paragraphs of this subsection applies, the securities intermediary’s jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the chief executive office of the securities intermediary is located.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> A securities intermediary’s jurisdiction is not determined by the physical location of certificates representing financial assets, or by the jurisdiction in which is organized the issuer of the financial asset with respect to which an entitlement holder has a security entitlement, or by the location of facilities for data processing or other record keeping concerning the account.</p>
