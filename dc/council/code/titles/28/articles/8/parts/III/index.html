                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> An indorsement, whether special or in blank, does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the certificate on which it appears or, if the indorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the document and the certificate.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> An indorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim to the certificate, but it does not otherwise affect a right to registration that the holder possesses.</p>
