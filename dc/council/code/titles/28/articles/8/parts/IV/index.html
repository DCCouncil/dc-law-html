The demand is effective only if it is received by the issuer at a time and in a manner affording the issuer reasonable opportunity to act on it.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction, or other process from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from registering the transfer; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> File with the issuer an indemnity bond, sufficient in the issuer’s judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar, or other agent of the issuer involved from any loss it or they may suffer by refusing to register the transfer.</p>
