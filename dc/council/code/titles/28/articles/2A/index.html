                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A “fixture filing” is the filing, in the office where a record of a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded, of a financing statement covering goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:9-502.html">28:9-502</a>(a) and (b).</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Under this article a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> This article does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 10 days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor’s interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The interest of a lessor of fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures the lease contract is enforceable;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee’s right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Notwithstanding subsection (d)(1) of this section but otherwise subject to subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, and the conflicting interest of a encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor’s residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).</p>
