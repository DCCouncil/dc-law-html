This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of recoupment or setoff. If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this article apply even though action of the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> After an item has been indorsed with the words “pay any bank” or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been:</p>

So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or possession or control of the accompanying documents for purposes other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to Article 9, but:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> No security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable (section 28:9-203(b)(e)(A));</p>
