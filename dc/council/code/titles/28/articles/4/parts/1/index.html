                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The specification or approval of certain procedures by this article is not disapproval of other procedures that may be reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care.
