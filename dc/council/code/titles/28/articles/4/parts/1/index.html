                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>1981 Ed., § 28:4-101.</p>
                <p>1973 Ed., § 28:4-101.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. The great number of checks handled by banks and the country-wide nature of the bank collection process require uniformity in the law of bank collections. There is needed a uniform statement of the principal rules of the bank collection process with ample provision for flexibility to meet the needs of the large volume handled and the changing needs and conditions that are bound to come with the years. This Article meets that need.</p>
                <p>2. In 1950 at the time Article 4 was drafted, 6.7 billion checks were written annually. By the time of the 1990 revision of Article 4 annual volume was estimated by the American Bankers Association to be about 50 billion checks. The banking system could not have coped with this increase in check volume had it not developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s an automated system for check collection based on encoding checks with machine-readable information by Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR). An important goal of the 1990 revision of Article 4 is to promote the efficiency of the check collection process by making the provisions of Article 4 more compatible with the needs of an automated system and, by doing so, increase the speed and lower the cost of check collection for those who write and receive checks. An additional goal of the 1990 revision of Article 4 is to remove any statutory barriers in the Article to the ultimate adoption of programs allowing the presentment of checks to payor banks by electronic transmission of information captured from the MICR line on the checks. The potential of these programs for saving the time and expense of transporting the huge volume of checks from depositary to payor banks is evident.</p>
                <p>3. Article 4 defines rights between parties with respect to bank deposits and collections. It is not a regulatory statute. It does not regulate the terms of the bank-customer agreement, nor does it prescribe what constraints different jurisdictions may wish to impose on that relationship in the interest of consumer protection. The revisions in Article 4 are intended to create a legal frame-work that accommodates automation and truncation for the benefit of all bank customers. This may raise consumer problems which enacting jurisdictions may wish to address in individual legislation. For example, with respect to  Section 4-401(c), jurisdictions may wish to examine their unfair and deceptive practices laws to determine whether they are adequate to protect drawers who postdate checks from unscrupulous practices that may arise on the part of persons who induce drawers to issue postdated checks in erroneous belief that the checks will not be immediately payable. Another example arises from the fact that under various truncation plans customers will no longer receive their cancelled checks and will no longer have the cancelled check to prove payment. Individual legislation might provide that a copy of a bank statement along with a copy of the check is prima facie evidence of payment.</p>

                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. The rules of Article 3 governing negotiable instruments, their transfer, and the contracts of the parties thereto apply to the items collected through banking channels wherever no specific provision is found in this Article. In the case of conflict, this Article governs. See  Section 3-102(b).</p>
                <p>Bonds and like instruments constituting investment securities under Article 8 may also be handled by banks for collection purposes. Various sections of Article 8 prescribe rules of transfer some of which (see  Sections 8-108 and  8-304) may conflict with provisions of this Article ( Sections 4-205,  4-207, and  4-208). In the case of conflict, Article 8 governs. Amendments approved by the Permanent Editorial Board for Uniform Commercial Code November 4, 1995.</p>
                <p>Section 4-210 deals specifically with overlapping problems and possible conflicts between this Article and Article 9. However, similar reconciling provisions are not necessary in the case of Articles 5 and 7.  Sections 4-301 and  4-302 are consistent with  Section 5-112. In the case of Article 7 documents of title frequently accompany items but they are not themselves items. See  Section 4-104(a)(9).</p>
                <p>In Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U.S. 363 (1943), the Court held that if the United States is a party to an instrument, its rights and duties are governed by federal common law in the absence of a specific federal statute or regulation.  In United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715 (1979), the Court stated a three-pronged test to ascertain whether the federal common-law rule should follow the state rule. In most instances courts under the Kimbell test have shown a willingness to adopt UCC rules in formulating federal common law on the subject. In Kimbell the Court adopted the priorities rules of Article 9.</p>
                <p>In addition, applicable federal law may supersede provisions of this Article. One federal law that does so is the Expedited Funds Availability Act,  12 U.S.C. § 4001 et seq., and its implementing Regulation CC,  12 CFR Pt. 229. In some instances this law is alluded to in the statute, e.g.,  Section 4-215(e) and (f). In other instances, although not referred to in this Article, the provisions of the EFAA and Regulation CC control with respect to checks. For example, except between the depositary bank and its customer, all settlements are final and not provisional (Regulation CC, Section 229.36(d)), and the midnight deadline may be extended (Regulation CC, Section 229.30(c)). The comments to this Article suggest in most instances the relevant Regulation CC provisions.</p>
                <p>2. Subsection (b) is designed to state a workable rule for the solution of otherwise vexatious problems of the conflicts of laws:</p>
                <p>a. The routine and mechanical nature of bank collections makes it imperative that one law govern the activities of one office of a bank. The requirement found in some cases that to hold an indorser notice must be given in accordance with the law of the place of indorsement, since that method of notice became an implied term of the indorser’s contract, is more theoretical than practical.</p>
                <p>b. Adoption of what is in essence a tort theory of the conflict of laws is consistent with the general theory of this Article that the basic duty of a collecting bank is one of good faith and and the exercise of ordinary care. Justification lies in the fact that, in using an ambulatory instrument, the drawer, payee, and indorsers must know that action will be taken with respect to it in other jurisdictions. This is especially pertinent with respect to the law of the place of payment.</p>
                <p>c. The phrase “action or non-action with respect to any item handled by it for purposes of presentment, payment, or collection“ is intended to make the conflicts rule of subsection (b) apply from the inception of the collection process of an item through all phases of deposit, forwarding, presentment, payment and remittance or credit of proceeds. Specifically the subsection applies to the initial act of a depositary bank in receiving an item and to the incidents of such receipt. The conflicts rule of  Weissman v. Banque de Bruxelles, 254 N.Y. 488, 173 N.E. 835 (1930), is rejected. The subsection applies to questions of possible vicarious liability of a bank for action or non-action of sub-agents (see  Section 4-202(c)), and tests these questions by the law of the state of the location of the bank which uses the sub-agent. The conflicts rule of  St. Nicholas Bank of New York v. State Nat. Bank, 128 N.Y. 26, 27 N.E. 849, 13 L.R.A. 241 (1891), is rejected. The subsection applied to action or non-action of a payor bank in connection with handling an item (see  Sections 4-215(a),  4-301,  4-302,  4-303) as well as action or non-action of a collecting bank ( Sections 4-201 through  4-216); to action or non-action of a bank which suspends payment or is affected by another bank suspending payment ( Section 4-216); to action or non-action of a bank with respect to an item under the rule of Part 4 of Article 4.</p>
                <p>d. In a case in which subsection (b) makes this Article applicable,  Section 4-103(a) leaves open the possibility of an agreement with respect to applicable law. This freedom of agreement follows the general policy of  Section 1-105. Reason for 1990 Change [<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/10-249.html">D.C. Law 10-249</a>]</p>

    </p>
                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>1981 Ed., § 28:4-103.</p>
                <p>1973 Ed., § 28:4-103.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1.  Section 1-102 states the general principles and rules for variation of the effect of this Act by agreement and the limitations to this power.  Section 4-103 states the specific rules for variation of Article 4 by agreement and also certain standards of ordinary care. In view of the technical complexity of the field of bank collections, the enormous number of items handled by banks, the certainty that there will be variations from the normal in each day’s work in each bank, the certainty of changing conditions and the possibility of developing improved methods of collection to speed the process, it would be unwise to freeze present methods of operation by mandatory statutory rules. This section, therefore, permits within wide limits variation of the effect of provisions of the Article by agreement.</p>
                <p>2. Subsection (a) confers blanket power to vary all provisions of the Article by agreements of the ordinary kind. The agreements may not disclaim a bank’s responsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care and may not limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure, but this subsection like  Section 1-102(3) approves the practice of parties determining by agreement the standards by which the responsibility is to be measured. In the absence of a showing that the standards manifestly are unreasonable, the agreement controls. Owners of items and other interested parties are not affected by agreements under this subsection unless they are parties to the agreement or are bound by adoption, ratification, estoppel or the like.</p>
                <p>As here used “agreement” has the meaning given to it by  Section 1-201(3). The agreement may be direct, as between the owner and the depositary bank; or indirect, as in the case in which the owner authorizes a particular type of procedure and any bank in the collection chain acts pursuant to such authorization. It may be with respect to a single item; or to all items handled for a particular customer, e.g., a general agreement between the depositary bank and the customer at the time a deposit account is opened. Legends on deposit tickets, collection letters and acknowledgments of items, coupled with action by the affected party constituting acceptance, adoption, ratification, estoppel or the like, are agreements if they meet the tests of the definition of “agreement.”  See Section 1-201(3).

                <p>3. Subsection (a) (subject to its limitations with respect to good faith and ordinary care) goes far to meet the requirements of flexibility. However, it does not by itself confer fully effective flexibility. Since it is recognized that banks handle a great number of items every business day and that the parties interested in each item include the owner of the item, the drawer (if it is a check), all nonbank indorsers, the payor bank and from one to five or more collecting banks, it is obvious that it is impossible, practically, to obtain direct agreements from all of these parties on all items. In total, the interested parties constitute virtually every adult person and business organization in the United States. On the other hand they may become bound to agreements on the principle that collecting banks acting as agents have authority to make binding agreements with respect to items being handled. This conclusion was assumed but was not flatly decided in  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond v. Malloy, 264 U.S. 160, at  167, 44 S.Ct. 296, at  298, 68 L.Ed. 617, 31 A.L.R. 1261 (1924).</p>
                <p>To meet this problem subsection (b) provides that official or quasi-official rules of collection, that is Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, clearing-house rules, and the like, have the effect of agreements under subsection (a), whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items handled. Consequently, such official or quasi-official rules may, standing by themselves but subject to the good faith and ordinary care limitations, vary the effect of the provisions of Article 4.</p>
                <p>Federal Reserve regulations. Various sections of the Federal Reserve Act ( 12 U.S.C. § 221 et seq.) authorize the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to direct the Federal Reserve banks to exercise bank collection functions. For example, Section 16 ( 12 U.S.C. § 248(o)) authorizes the Board to require each Federal Reserve bank to exercise the functions of a clearing house for its members and Section 13 ( 12 U.S.C. § 342) authorizes each Federal Reserve bank to receive deposits from nonmember banks solely for the purposes of exchange or of collection. Under this statutory authorization the Board has issued Regulation J (Subpart A—Collection of Checks and Other Items). Under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, federal regulations prevail over state statutes. Moreover, the Expedited Funds Availability Act,  12 U.S.C. Section 4007(b) provides that the Act and Regulation CC,  12 CFR 229, supersede “any provision of the law of any State, including the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in such State, which is inconsistent with this chapter or such regulations.“ See Comment 1 to  Section 4-102.</p>
                <p>Federal Reserve operating circulars. The regulations of the Federal Reserve Board authorize the Federal Reserve banks to promulgate operating circulars covering operating details. Regulation J, for example, provides that “Each Reserve Bank shall receive and handle items in accordance with this subpart, and shall issue operating circulars governing the details of its handling of items and other matters deemed appropriate by the Reserve Bank.“ This Article recognizes that ‘’operating circulars“ issued pursuant to the regulations and concerned with operating details as appropriate may, within their proper sphere, vary the effect of the Article.</p>
                <p>Clearing-House Rules. Local clearing houses have long issued rules governing the details of clearing; hours of clearing, media of remittance, time for return of mis-sent items and the like. The case law has recognized these rules, within their proper sphere, as binding on affected parties and as appropriate sources for the courts to look to in filling out details of bank collection law. Subsection (b) in recognizing clearing-house rules as a means if preserving flexibility continues the sensible approach indicated in the cases. Included in the terms “clearing houses” are county and regional clearing houses as well as those within a single city or town. There is, of course, no intention of authorizing a local clearing house or a group of clearing houses to rewrite the basic law generally. The term “clearing-house rules” should be understood in the light of functions the clearing houses have exercised in the past.</p>
                <p>And the like. This phrase is to be construed in the light of the foregoing. “Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars” cover rules and regulations issued by public or quasi-public agencies under statutory authority. “Clearing-house rules” cover rules issued by a group of banks which have associated themselves to perform through a clearing house some of their collection, payment and clearing functions. Other agencies or associations of this kind may be established in the future whose rules and regulations could be appropriately looked on as constituting means of avoiding absolute statutory rigidity. The phrase “and the like” leaves open possibilities for future development. An agreement between a number of banks or even all the banks in an area simply because they are banks, would not of itself, by virtue of the phrase “and the like,” meet the purposes and objectives of subsection (b).</p>
                <p>4. Under this Article banks come under the general obligations of the use of good faith and the exercise of ordinary care. “Good faith” is defined in  Section 3-103(a)(4). The term “ordinary care” is defined in  Section 3-103(a)(7). These definitions are made to apply to Article 4 by  Section 4-104(c).  Section 4-202 states respects in which collecting banks must use ordinary care. Subsection (c) of  Section 4-103 provides that action or non-action approved by the Article or pursuant to Federal Reserve regulations or operating circulars constitutes the exercise of ordinary care. Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars constitute an affirmative standard of ordinary care equally with the provisions of Article 4 itself.</p>
                <p>Subsection (c) further provides that, absent special instructions, action or non-action consistent with clearing-house rules and the like or with a general banking usage not disapproved by the Article, prima facie constitutes the exercise of ordinary care. Clearing-house rules and the phrase “and the like” have the significance set forth above in these Comments. The term “general banking usage“ is not defined but should be taken to mean a general usage common to banks in the area concerned. See  Section 1-205(2). In a case in which the adjective “general” is used, the intention is to require a usage broader than a mere practice between two or three banks but it is not intended to require anything as broad as a country-wide usage. A usage followed generally throughout a state, a substantial portion of a state, a metropolitan area or the like would certainly be sufficient. Consistently with the principle of  Section 1-205(3), action or non-action consistent with clearing-house rules or the like or with banking usages prima facie constitutes the exercise of ordinary care. However, the phrase “in the absence of special instructions” affords owners of items an opportunity to prescribe other standards and although there may be no direct supervision or control of clearing houses or banking usages by official supervisory authorities, the confirmation of ordinary care by compliance with these standards is prima facie only, thus conferring on the courts the ultimate power to determine ordinary care in any case in which it should appear desirable to do so. The prima facie rule does, however, impose on the party contesting the standards to establish that they are unreasonable, arbitrary or unfair as used by the particular bank.</p>
                <p>5. Subsection (d), in line with the flexible approach required for the bank collection process is designed to make clear that a novel procedure adopted by a bank is not to be considered unreasonable merely because that procedure is not specifically contemplated by this Article or by agreement, or because it has not yet been generally accepted as a bank usage. Changing conditions constantly call for new procedures and someone has to use the new procedure first. If this procedure is found to be reasonable under the circumstances, provided, of course, that it is not inconsistent with any provision of the Article or other law or agreement, the bank which has followed the new procedure should not be found to have failed in the exercise of ordinary care.</p>
                <p>6. Subsection (e) sets forth a rule for determining the measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care which, under subsection (a), cannot be limited by agreement. In the absence of bad faith the maximum recovery is the amount of the item concerned. The term “bad faith” is not defined; the connotation is the absence of good faith ( Section 3-103). When it is established that some part or all of the item could not have been collected even by the use of ordinary care the recovery is reduced by the amount that would have been in any event uncollectible. This limitation on recovery follows the case law. Finally, if bad faith is established the rule opens to allow the recovery of other damages, whose “proximateness” is to be tested by the ordinary rules applied in comparable cases. Of course, it continues to be as necessary under subsection (e) as it has been under ordinary common law principles that, before the damage rule of the subsection becomes operative, liability of the bank and some loss to the customer or owner must be established.</p>

                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p>The 2013 amendment by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-299.html">D.C. Law 19-299</a> deleted the definition of “Bank” in (b); in (c), added “ ‘Control’ as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:7-106.html">28:7-106</a> and” at the beginning of the introductory language, deleted the definition of “Good faith”; and added the definitions of “Record” and “Remotely created consumer item.”</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. Paragraph (a)(1): “Account” is defined to include both asset accounts in which a customer has deposited money and accounts from which a customer may draw on a line of credit. The limiting factor is that the account must be in a bank.</p>
                <p>2. Paragraph (a)(3): “Banking day.” Under this definition that part of a business day when a bank is open only for limited functions, e.g., to receive deposits and cash checks, but with loan, bookkeeping and other departments closed, is not part of a banking day.</p>
                <p>3. Paragraph (a)(4): “Clearing house.” Occasionally express companies, governmental agencies and other nonbanks deal directly with a clearing house; hence the definition does not limit the term to an association of banks.</p>
                <p>4. Paragraph (a)(5): “Customer.” It is to be noted that this term includes a bank carrying an account with another bank as well as the more typical nonbank customer or depositor.</p>
                <p>5. Paragraph (a)(6): “Documentary draft” applies even though the documents do not accompany the draft but are to be received by the drawee or other payor before acceptance or payment of the draft.</p>
                <p>6. Paragraph (a)(7): “Draft” is defined in  Section 3-104 as a form of instrument. Since Article 4 applies to items that may not fall within the definition of instrument, the term is defined here to include an item that is a written order to pay money, even though the item may not qualify as an instrument. The term “order” is defined in  Section 3-103.</p>
                <p>7. Paragraph (a)(8): “Drawee” is defined in  Section 3-103 in terms of an Article 3 draft which is a form of instrument. Here “drawee” is defined in terms of an Article 4 draft which includes items that may not be instruments.</p>
                <p>8. Paragraph (a)(9): “Item” is defined broadly to include an instrument, as defined in  Section 3-104, as well as promises or orders that may not be within the definition of “instrument.” The terms “promise” and “order” are defined in  Section 3-103. A promise is a written undertaking to pay money. An order is a written instruction to pay money. But see  Section 4-110(c). Since bonds and other investment securities under Article 8 may be within the term “instrument” or “promise,” they are items and when handled by banks for collection are subject to this Article. See Comment 1 to  Section 4-102. The functional limitation on the meaning of this term is the willingness of the banking system to handle the instrument, undertaking or instruction for collection or payment.</p>
                <p>9. Paragraph (a)(10): “Midnight deadline.” The use of this phrase is an example of the more mechanical approach used in this Article. Midnight is selected as a termination point or time limit to obtain greater uniformity and definiteness than would be possible from other possible terminating points, such as the close of the banking day or business day.</p>
                <p>10. Paragraph (a)(11): The term “settle” has substantial importance throughout Article 4. In the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, in deferred posting statutes, in Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, in clearing-house rules, in agreements between banks and customers and in legends on deposit tickets and collection letters, there is repeated reference to “conditional” or “provisional” credits or payments. Tied in with this concept of credits or payments being in some way tentative, has been a related but somewhat different problem as to when an item is “paid” or “finally paid” either to determine the relative priority of the item as against attachments, stop-payment orders and the like or in insolvency situations. There has been extensive litigation in the various states on these problems. To a substantial extent the confusion, the litigation and even the resulting court decisions fail to take into account that in the collection process some debits or credits are provisional or tentative and others are final and that very many debits or credits are provisional or tentative for awhile but later become final.</p>
                <p>Similarly, some cases fail to recognize that within a single bank, particularly a payor bank, each item goes through a series of processes and that in a payor bank most of these processes are preliminary to the basic act of payment or “final payment.”</p>
                <p>The term “settle” is used as a convenient term to characterize a broad variety of conditional, provisional, tentative and also final payments of items. Such a comprehensive term is needed because it is frequently difficult or unnecessary to determine whether a particular action is tentative or final or when a particular credit shifts from the tentative class to the final class. Therefore, its use throughout the Article indicates that in that particular context it is unnecessary or unwise to determine whether the debit or the credit or the payment is tentative or final. However, if qualified by the adjective “provisional” its tentative nature is intended, and if qualified by the adjective “final” its permanent nature is intended.</p>
                <p>Examples of the various types of settlement contemplated by the term include payments in cash; the efficient but somewhat complicated process of payment through the adjustment and offsetting of balances through clearing houses; debit or credit entries in accounts between banks; the forwarding of various types of remittance instruments, sometimes to cover a particular item but more frequently to cover an entire group of items received on a particular day.</p>
                <p>11. Paragraph (a)(12): “Suspends payments.” This term is designed to afford an objective test to determine when a bank is no longer operating as a part of the banking system.</p>
                <p>Reason for 1990 Change [<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/10-249.html">D.C. Law 10-249</a>]</p>
                <p>The definition of “account” is amended to make clear that it includes both asset accounts in which a customer has deposited money and accounts from which a customer may draw on a line of credit. The remainder of the definition is amended to bring it more into conformity with the definition of “deposit account” in  Section 9-105(1)(e).</p>
                <p>The definition of “documentary draft” is amended to recognize the existence of uncertificated securities. The reference to “accompanying documents” is deleted as obsolete. It is enough that the documents are to be received by the drawee or other payor before acceptance or payment of the draft.</p>
                <p>The definition of “draft” is new and is explained in the Official Comment.</p>
                <p>The definition of “drawee” is new and is explained in the Official Comment.</p>
                <p>The definition of “item” is amended because the term “instrument” as defined in  Section 3-104 and as used in Article 4 is narrower than the term “item.” See the Official Comment.</p>
                <p>The definition of “properly payable” is deleted. In former Article 4 there is no affirmative definition of the term “properly payable.“ Former  Section 4-104(1)(i) merely implies that if the customer’s account is insufficient to pay the item the item is not properly payable. The phrase is defined in proposed  Section 4-401(1) in terms of the items authorized by the customer and in accordance with the bank-customer agreement. This is done to give meaning to “properly payable” in  Sections 4-401(1) and  4-402(1).</p>
                <p>The latter provision makes clear that a bank that fails to pay an overdraft has not wrongfully dishonored unless it had agreed to pay the overdraft.</p>
                <p>The definition of “settle” is amended in changing “instructed” to “agreed” to conform to  Section 4-213.</p>
                <p>The terms “remitting bank,” “protest,” and “second party” are deleted because they are not used in Article 4.</p>
                <p>The other modifications are made to conform with current legislative drafting practices, with no intent to change substance.</p>

                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p>The 2013 amendment by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-299.html">D.C. Law 19-299</a> rewrote the section heading, which read “Bank”; “depositary bank”; “payor bank”; “intermediary bank”; “collecting bank”; “presenting bank”.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. The definitions in general exclude a bank to which an item is issued, as this bank does not take by transfer except in the particular case covered in which the item is issued to payee for collection, as in the case in which a corporation is transferring balances from one account to another. Thus, the definition of “depositary bank” does not include the bank to which a check is made payable if a check is given in payment of a mortgage. This bank has the status of a payee under Article 3 on Negotiable Instruments and not that of a collecting bank.</p>
                <p>2. Paragraph (1): “Bank” is defined in  Section 1-201(4) as meaning “any person engaged in the business of banking.” The definition in paragraph (1) makes clear that “bank” includes savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and trust companies, in addition to the commercial banks commonly denoted by use of the term “bank.”</p>
                <p>3. Paragraph (2): A bank that takes an “on us” item for collection, for application to a customer’s loan, or first handles the item for other reasons is a depositary bank even though it is also the payor bank. However, if the holder presents the item for immediate payment over the counter, the payor bank is not a depositary bank.</p>
                <p>4. Paragraph (3): The definition of “payor bank” is clarified by use of the term “drawee.” That term is defined in  Section 4-104 as meaning “a person ordered in a draft to make payment.” An “order” is defined in  Section 3-103 as meaning “a written instruction to pay money . . . An authorization to pay is not an order unless the person authorized to pay is also instructed to pay.“ The definition of order is incorporated into Article 4 by  Section 4-104(c). Thus a payor bank is one instructed to pay in the item. A bank does not become a payor bank by being merely authorized to pay or by being given an instruction to pay not contained in the item.</p>
                <p>5. Paragraph (4): The term “intermediary bank” includes the last bank in the collection process if the drawee is not a bank. Usually the last bank is also a presenting bank.</p>
                <p>Reason for 1990 Change [<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/10-249.html">D.C. Law 10-249</a>]</p>
                <p>The definition of “bank” is added and is in conformity with that found in Section 4A-105(a)(2). See the Official Comment.</p>
                <p>The definition of “depositary bank” is amended. The term “transferred for collection” is too limiting as the purpose for which the item is taken. The amendment makes clear that a payor bank is not also a depositary bank with respect to an item presented for immediate payment over the counter.</p>
                <p>The definition of “payor bank” is amended to require that in order for a bank to be a payor bank it must be instructed rather than authorized to pay and that the instruction must be contained in the item. As explained in the Official Comment, this result follows from the use of the defined terms “drawee” and “draft.”</p>
                <p>The definition of “remitting bank” is deleted because the term is not used in Article 4.</p>
                <p>The other modifications are made to conform with current legislative drafting practices, with no intent to change substance.</p>

                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. This section replaces former  Sections 3-120 and  3-121. Some items are made “payable through” a particular bank. Subsection (a) states that such language makes the bank a collecting bank and not a payor bank. An item identifying a “payable through” bank can be presented for payment to the drawee only by the “payable through” bank. The item cannot be presented to the drawee over the counter for immediate payment or by a collecting bank other than the “payable through” bank.</p>
                <p>2. Subsection (b) retains the alternative approach of the present law. Under Alternative A a note payable at a bank is the equivalent of a draft drawn on the bank and the midnight deadline provisions of  Sections 4-301 and  4-302 apply. Under Alternative B a “payable at” bank is in the same position as a “payable through” bank under subsection (a).</p>
                <p>3. Subsection (c) rejects the view of some cases that a bank named below the name of a drawee is itself a drawee. The commercial understanding is that this bank is a collecting bank and is not accountable under  Section 4-302 for holding an item beyond its deadline. The liability of the bank is governed by  Sections 4-202(a) and  4-103(e).</p>

                <p>A branch or separate office of a bank is a separate bank for the purpose of computing the time within which and determining the place at or to which action may be taken or notice or orders must be given under this article and under Article 3.</p>

                <p>1981 Ed., § 28:4-107.</p>
                <p>1973 Ed., § 28:4-106.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. A rule with respect to the status of a branch or separate office of a bank as a part of any statute on bank collections is highly desirable if not absolutely necessary. However, practices in the operations of branches and separate offices vary substantially in the different states and it has not been possible to find any single rule that is logically correct, fair in all situations and workable under all different types of practices. The decision not to draft the section with greater specificity leaves to the courts the resolution of the issues arising under this section on the basis of the facts of each case.</p>
                <p>2. In many states and for many purposes a branch or separate office of the bank should be treated as a separate bank. Many branches function as separate banks in the handling and payment of items and require time for doing so similar to that of a separate bank. This is particularly true if branch banking is permitted throughout a state or in different towns and cities. Similarly, if there is this separate functioning a particular branch or separate office is the only proper place for various types of action to be taken or orders or notices to be given. Examples include the drawing of a check on a particular branch by a customer whose account is carried at that branch; the presentment of that same check at that branch; the issuance of an order to the branch to stop payment on the check.</p>
                <p>3. Section 1 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code provided simply: “A branch or office of any such bank shall be deemed a bank.“ Although this rule appears to be brief and simple, as applied to particular sections of the ABA Code it produces illogical and, in some cases, unreasonable results. For example, under Section 11 of the ABA Code it seems anomalous for one branch of a bank to have charged an item to the account of the drawer and another branch to have the power to elect to treat the item as dishonored. Similar logical problems would flow from applying the same rule to Article 4. Warranties by one branch to another branch under  Sections 4-207 and  4-208 (each considered a separate bank) do not make sense.</p>
                <p>4. Assuming that it is not desirable to make each branch a separate bank for all purposes, this section provides that a branch or separate office is a separate bank for certain purposes. In so doing the single legal entity of the bank as a whole is preserved, thereby carrying with it the liability of the institution as a whole on such obligations as it may be under. On the other hand, in cases in which the Article provides a number of time limits for different types of action by banks, if a branch functions as a separate bank, it should have the time limits available to a separate bank. Similarly if in its relations to customers a branch functions as a separate bank, notices and orders with respect to accounts of customers of the branch should be given at the branch.</p>
                <p>For example, whether a branch has notice sufficient to affect its status as a holder in due course of an item taken by it should depend upon what notice that branch has received with respect to the item. Similarly the receipt of a stop-payment order at one branch should not be notice to another branch so as to impair the right of the second branch to be a holder in due course of the item, although in circumstances in which ordinary care requires the communication of a notice or order to the proper branch of a bank, the notice or order would be effective at the proper branch from the time it was or should have been received. See  Section 1-201(27).</p>
                <p>5. The bracketed language (“maintaining its own deposit ledger”) in former  Section 4-106 is deleted. Today banks keep records on customer accounts by electronic data storage. This has led most banks with branches to centralize to some degree their record keeping. The place where records are kept has little meaning if the information is electronically stored and is instantly retrievable at all branches of the bank. Hence, the inference to be drawn from the deletion of the bracketed language is that where record keeping is done is no longer an important factor in determining whether a branch is a separate bank.</p>

                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. Each of the huge volume of checks processed each day must go through a series of accounting procedures that consume time. Many banks have found it necessary to establish a cutoff hour to allow time for these procedures to be completed within the time limits imposed by Article 4. Subsection (a) approves a cutoff hour of this type provided it is not earlier than 2 P.M. Subsection (b) provides that if such a cutoff hour is fixed, items received after the cutoff hour may be treated as being received at the opening of the next banking day. If the number of items received either through the mail or over the counter tends to taper off radically as the afternoon hours progress, a 2 P.M. cutoff hour does not involve a large portion of the items received but at the same time permits a bank using such a cutoff hour to leave its doors open later in the afternoon without forcing into the evening the completion of its settling and proving process.</p>
                <p>2. The provision in subsection (b) that items or deposits received after the close of the banking day may be treated as received at the opening of the next banking day is important in cases in which a bank closes at twelve or one o’clock, e.g., on a Saturday, but continues to receive some items by mail or over the counter if, for example, it opens Saturday evening for the limited purpose of receiving deposits and cashing checks.</p>

                <p>1973 Ed., § 28:4-108.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1.  Sections 4-202(b),  4-214,  4-301, and  4-302 prescribe various time limits for the handling of items. These are the limits of time within which a bank, in fulfillment of its obligation to exercise ordinary care, must handle items entrusted to it for collection or payment. Under  Section 4-103 they may be varied by agreement or by Federal Reserve regulations or operating circular, clearing-house rules, or the like. Subsection (a) permits a very limited extension of these time limits. It authorizes a collecting bank to take additional time in attempting to collect drafts drawn on nonbank payors with or without the approval of any interested party. The right of a collecting bank to waive time limits under subsection (a) does not apply to checks. The two-day extension can only by granted in a good faith effort to secure payment and only with respect to specific items. It cannot be exercised if the customer instructs otherwise. Thus limited the escape provision should afford a limited degree of flexibility in special cases but should not interfere with the overall requirement and objective of speedy collections.</p>
                <p>2. An extension granted under subsection (a) is without discharge of drawers or indorsers. It therefore extends the times for presentment or payment as specified in Article 3.</p>
                <p>3. Subsection (b) is another escape clause from time limits. This clause operates not only with respect to time limits imposed by the Article itself but also time limits imposed by special instructions, by agreement or by Federal regulations or operating circulars, clearing-house rules or the like. The latter time limits are “permitted” by the Code. For example, a payor bank that fails to make timely return of a dishonored item may be accountable for the amount of the item. Subsection (b) excuses a bank from this liability when its failure to meet its midnight deadline resulted from, for example, a computer breakdown that was beyond the control of the bank, so long as the bank exercised the degree of diligence that the circumstances required.  In Port City State Bank v. American National Bank, 486 F.2d 196 (10th Cir. 1973), the court held that a bank exercised sufficient diligence to be excused under this subsection. If delay is sought to be excused under this subsection, the bank has the burden of proof on the issue of whether it exercised “such diligence as the circumstances require.” The subsection is consistent with Regulation CC, Section 229.38(e).</p>
                <p>Reason for 1990 Change [<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/10-249.html">D.C. Law 10-249</a>]</p>
                <p>Subsection (a) is amended to exclude checks and other items drawn on banks from its application so that the provision will not impede the speedy collection of these items. The amended subsection authorizes a collecting bank to take additional time, not in excess of two days, in a good faith effort to collect drafts drawn on nonbank payors with or without the approval of any interested party. The term “secondary parties” is deleted because it is no longer used in Articles 3 and 4. Subsection (b) is amended to make clear that the delay is excused for one of the reasons stated only if the bank exercises such diligence as the circumstances require. With the addition of references to the interruption of computer facilities and the failure of equipment, the permissible reasons for delay enumerated are made to conform to those stated in Regulation CC Section 229.38(e). The other modifications are made to conform with current legislative drafting practices, with no intent to change substance.</p>

                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. “An agreement for electronic presentment” refers to an agreement under which presentment may be made to a payor bank by a presentment notice rather than by presentment of the item. Under imaging technology now under development, the presentment notice might be an image of the item. The electronic presentment agreement may provide that the item may be retained by a depositary bank, other collecting bank, or even a customer of the depositary bank, or it may provide that the item will follow the presentment notice. The identifying characteristic of an electronic presentment agreement is that presentment occurs when the presentment notice is received. “An agreement for electronic presentment” does not refer to the common case of retention of items by payor banks because the item itself is presented to the payor bank in these cases. Payor bank check retention is a matter of agreement between payor banks and their customers. Provisions on payor bank check retention are found in  Section 4-406(b).</p>
                <p>2. The assumptions under which the electronic presentment amendments are based are as follows: No bank will participate in an electronic presentment program without an agreement. These agreements may be either bilateral ( Section 4-103(a)), under which two banks that frequently do business with each other may agree to depositary bank check retention, or multilateral ( Section 4-103(b)), in which large segments of the banking industry may participate in such a program. In the latter case, federal or other uniform regulatory standards would likely supply the substance of the electronic presentment agreement, the application of which could be triggered by the use of some form of identifier on the item. Regulation CC, Section 229.36(c) authorizes truncation agreements but forbids them from extending return times or otherwise varying requirements of the part of Regulation CC governing check collection without the agreement of all parties interested in the check. For instance, an extension of return time could damage a depositary bank which must make funds available to its customers under mandatory availability schedules. The Expedited Funds Availability Act,  12 U.S.C. Section 4008(b)(2), directs the Federal Reserve Board to consider requiring that banks provide for check truncation.</p>
                <p>3. The parties affected by an agreement for electronic presentment, with the exception of the customer, can be expected to protect themselves. For example, the payor bank can probably be expected to limit its risk of loss from drawer forgery by limiting the dollar amount of eligible items (Federal Reserve program), by reconcilement agreements (ABA Safekeeping program), by insurance (credit union share draft program), or by other means. Because agreements will exist, only minimal amendments are needed to make clear that the UCC does not prohibit electronic presentment.</p>

                <p>This section conforms to the period of limitations set by  Section 3-118(g) for actions for breach of warranty and to enforce other obligations, duties or rights arising under Article 3. Bracketing “cause of action” recognizes that some states use a different term, such as “claim for relief.”</p>
