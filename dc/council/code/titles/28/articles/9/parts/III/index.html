                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c).</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A security interest that is perfected under subsection (d) has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If more than 1 security interest is perfected under subsection (d), the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods.</p>
