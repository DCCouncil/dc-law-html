                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A security interest in goods is a purchase-money security interest:</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to software in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> A security interest in software is a purchase-money security interest to the extent that the security interest also secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to goods in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest if:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The debtor acquired its interest in the software in an integrated transaction in which it acquired an interest in the goods; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The debtor acquired its interest in the software for the principal purpose of using the software in the goods.</p>
