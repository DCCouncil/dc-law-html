                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement; or</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> When the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed; or</p>
