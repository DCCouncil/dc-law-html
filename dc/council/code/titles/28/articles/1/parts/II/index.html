                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/13-201.html">D.C. Law 13-201</a>, enacting a new Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code applicable July 1, 2001, made conforming amendments to this section applicable upon the same date.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Source:</strong> Former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes from former law:</strong> In order to make it clear that all definitions in the Uniform Commercial Code (not just those appearing in Article 1, as stated in former  Section 1-201, but also those appearing in other Articles) do not apply if the context otherwise requires, a new subsection (a) to that effect has been added, and the definitions now appear in subsection (b). The reference in subsection (a) to the “context” is intended to refer to the context in which the defined term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code. In other words, the definition applies whenever the defined term is used unless the context in which the defined term is used in the statute indicates that the term was not used in its defined sense. Consider, for example,  Sections 3-103(a)(9) (defining “promise,” in relevant part, as “a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay”) and 3-303(a)(1) (indicating that an instrument is issued or transferred for value if “the instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed.” It is clear from the statutory context of the use of the word “promise” in  Section 3-303(a)(1) that the term was not used in the sense of its definition in  Section 3-103(a)(9). Thus, the  Section 3-103(a)(9) definition should not be used to give meaning to the word “promise” in  Section 3-303(a).</p>
                <p>Some definitions in former  Section 1-201 have been reformulated as substantive provisions and have been moved to other sections. See  Sections 1-202 (explicating concepts of notice and knowledge formerly addressed in  Sections 1-201(25)-(27)), 1-204 (determining when a person gives value for rights, replacing the definition of “value” in former  Section 1-201(44)), and 1-206 (addressing the meaning of presumptions, replacing the definitions of “presumption” and “presumed” in former  Section 1-201(31)). Similarly, the portion of the definition of “security interest” in former  Section 1-201(37) which explained the difference between a security interest and a lease has been relocated to  Section 1-203.</p>
                <p>Two definitions in former  Section 1-201 have been deleted. The definition of “honor” in former  Section 1-201(21) has been moved to  Section 2-103(1)(b), inasmuch as the definition only applies to the use of the word in Article 2. The definition of “telegram” in former  Section 1-201(41) has been deleted because that word no longer appears in the definition of “conspicuous.”</p>
                <p>Other than minor stylistic changes and renumbering, the remaining definitions in this section are as in former Article 1 except as noted below.</p>
                <p>1. “Action.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201, which was derived from similar definitions in Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</p>
                <p>2. “Aggrieved party.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>3. “Agreement.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. As used in the Uniform Commercial Code the word is intended to include full recognition of usage of trade, course of dealing, course of performance and the surrounding circumstances as effective parts thereof, and of any agreement permitted under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code to displace a stated rule of law. Whether an agreement has legal consequences is determined by applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and, to the extent provided in  Section 1-103, by the law of contracts.</p>
                <p>4. “Bank.” Derived from Section 4A-104.</p>
                <p>5. “Bearer.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201, which was derived from Section 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law.</p>
                <p>6. “Bill of Lading.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. The reference to, and definition of, an “airbill” has been deleted as no longer necessary.</p>
                <p>7. “Branch.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>8. “Burden of establishing a fact.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>9. “Buyer in ordinary course of business.” Except for minor stylistic changes, identical to former  Section 1-201 (as amended in conjunction with the 1999 revisions to Article 9). The major significance of the phrase lies in  Section 2-403 and in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).</p>
                <p>The first sentence of paragraph (9) makes clear that a buyer from a pawnbroker cannot be a buyer in ordinary course of business. The second sentence explains what it means to buy “in the ordinary course.” The penultimate sentence prevents a buyer that does not have the right to possession as against the seller from being a buyer in ordinary course of business. Concerning when a buyer obtains possessory rights, see  Sections 2-502 and  2-716. However, the penultimate sentence is not intended to affect a buyer’s status as a buyer in ordinary course of business in cases (such as a “drop shipment”) involving delivery by the seller to a person buying from the buyer or a donee from the buyer. The requirement relates to whether as against the seller the buyer or one taking through the buyer has possessory rights.</p>
                <p>10. “Conspicuous.” Derived from former  Section 1-201(10). This definition states the general standard that to be conspicuous a term ought to be noticed by a reasonable person. Whether a term is conspicuous is an issue for the court. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) set out several methods for making a term conspicuous. Requiring that a term be conspicuous blends a notice function (the term ought to be noticed) and a planning function (giving guidance to the party relying on the term regarding how that result can be achieved). Although these paragraphs indicate some of the methods for making a term attention-calling, the test is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it. The statutory language should not be construed to permit a result that is inconsistent with that test.</p>
                <p>11. “Consumer.” Derived from  Section 9-102(a)(25).</p>
                <p>12. “Contract.” Except for minor stylistic changes, identical to former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>13. “Creditor.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>14. “Defendant.” Except for minor stylistic changes, identical to former  Section 1-201, which was derived from Section 76, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
                <p>15. “Delivery.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. The reference to certificated securities has been deleted in light of the more specific treatment of the matter in  Section 8-301.</p>
                <p>16. “Document of title.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201, which was derived from Section 76, Uniform Sales Act. By making it explicit that the obligation or designation of a third party as “bailee” is essential to a document of title, this definition clearly rejects any such result as obtained in<em>Hixson v. Ward</em>, 254 Ill.App. 505 (1929), which treated a conditional sales contract as a document of title. Also the definition is left open so that new types of documents may be included. It is unforeseeable what documents may one day serve the essential purpose now filled by warehouse receipts and bills of lading. Truck transport has already opened up problems which do not fit the patterns of practice resting upon the assumption that a draft can move through banking channels faster than the goods themselves can reach their destination. There lie ahead air transport and such probabilities as teletype transmission of what may some day be regarded commercially as “Documents of Title.” The definition is stated in terms of the function of the documents with the intention that any document which gains commercial recognition as accomplishing the desired result shall be included within its scope. Fungible goods are adequately identified within the language of the definition by identification of the mass of which they are a part.</p>
                <p>Dock warrants were within the Sales Act definition of document of title apparently for the purpose of recognizing a valid tender by means of such paper. In current commercial practice a dock warrant or receipt is a kind of interim certificate issued by steamship companies upon delivery of the goods at the dock, entitling a designated person to have issued to him at the company’s office a bill of lading. The receipt itself is invariably nonnegotiable in form although it may indicate that a negotiable bill is to be forthcoming. Such a document is not within the general compass of the definition, although trade usage may in some cases entitle such paper to be treated as a document of title. If the dock receipt actually represents a storage obligation undertaken by the shipping company, then it is a warehouse receipt within this section regardless of the name given to the instrument.</p>
                <p>The goods must be “described,” but the description may be by marks or labels and may be qualified in such a way as to disclaim personal knowledge of the issuer regarding contents or condition. However, baggage and parcel checks and similar “tokens” of storage which identify stored goods only as those received in exchange for the token are not covered by this Article.</p>
                <p>The definition is broad enough to include an airway bill.</p>
                <p>17. “Fault.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. “Default” has been added to the list of events constituting fault.</p>
                <p>18. “Fungible goods.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. References to securities have been deleted because Article 8 no longer uses the term “fungible” to describe securities. Accordingly, this provision now defines the concept only in the context of goods.</p>
                <p>19. “Genuine.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>20. “Good faith.” Former  Section 1-201(19) defined “good faith” simply as honesty in fact; the definition contained no element of commercial reasonableness. Initially, that definition applied throughout the Code with only one exception. Former  Section 2-103(1)(b) provided that “<em>in this Article . . .in Article 2;thus, so construed it would not define “good faith” for its most important use- the obligation of good faith imposed by former  Section 1-203.</em>good faith in the case of a merchant means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.” This alternative definition was limited in applicability in three ways. First, it applied only to transactions within the scope of Article 2. Second, it applied only to merchants. Third, strictly construed it applied only to uses of the phrase “good faith”  </p>
                <p>Over time, however, amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code brought the Article 2 merchant concept of good faith (subjective honesty and objective commercial reasonableness) into other Articles. First, Article 2A explicitly incorporated the Article 2 standard. See Section 2A-103(7). Then, other Articles broadened the applicability of that standard by adopting it for all parties rather than just for merchants.<em>See, e.g.andthe observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. Only revised Article 5 defines “good faith” solely in terms of subjective honesty, and only Article 6 and Article 7 are without definitions of good faith. (It should be noted that, while revised Article 6 did not define good faith, Comment 2 to revised  Section 6-102 states that “this Article adopts the definition of ‘good faith’ in Article 1 in all cases, even when the buyer is a merchant.”) Given these developments, it is appropriate to move the broader definition of “good faith” to Article 1. Of course, this definition is subject to the applicability of the narrower definition in revised Article 5.</em>,  Sections 3-103(a)(4), 4A-105(a)(6), 8-102(a)(10), and 9-102(a)(43). All of these definitions are comprised of two elements- honesty in fact  </p>
                <p>21. “Holder.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. The definition has been reorganized for clarity.</p>
                <p>22. “Insolvency proceedings.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>23. “Insolvent.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. The three tests of insolvency- “generally ceased to pay debts in the ordinary course of business other than as a result of a bona fide dispute as to them,” “unable to pay debts as they become due,” and “insolvent within the meaning of the federal bankruptcy law”- are expressly set up as alternative tests and must be approached from a commercial standpoint.</p>
                <p>24. “Money.” Substantively identical to former  Section 1-201. The test is that of sanction of government, whether by authorization before issue or adoption afterward, which recognizes the circulating medium as a part of the official currency of that government. The narrow view that money is limited to legal tender is rejected.</p>
                <p>25. “Organization.” The former definition of this word has been replaced with the standard definition used in acts prepared by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</p>
                <p>26. “Party.” Substantively identical to former  Section 1-201. Mention of a party includes, of course, a person acting through an agent. However, where an agent comes into opposition or contrast to the principal, particular account is taken of that situation.</p>
                <p>27. “Person.” The former definition of this word has been replaced with the standard definition used in acts prepared by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</p>
                <p>28. “Present value.” This definition was formerly contained within the definition of “security interest” in former  Section 1-201(37).</p>
                <p>29. “Purchase.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. The form of definition has been changed from “includes” to “means.”</p>
                <p>30. “Purchaser.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>31. “Record.” Derived from  Section 9-102(a)(69).</p>
                <p>32. “Remedy.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201. The purpose is to make it clear that both remedy and right (as defined) include those remedial rights of “self help” which are among the most important bodies of rights under the Uniform Commercial Code, remedial rights being those to which an aggrieved party may resort on its own.</p>
                <p>33. “Representative.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. Reorganized, and form changed from “includes” to “means.”</p>
                <p>34. “Right.” Except for minor stylistic changes, identical to former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>35. “Security Interest.” The definition is the first paragraph of the definition of “security interest” in former  Section 1-201, with minor stylistic changes. The remaining portion of that definition has been moved to  Section 1-203. Note that, because of the scope of Article 9, the term includes the interest of certain outright buyers of certain kinds of property.</p>
                <p>36. “Send.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. Compare “notifies”.</p>
                <p>37. “Signed.” Derived from former  Section 1-201. Former  Section 1-201 referred to “intention to authenticate”; because other articles now use the term “authenticate,” the language has been changed to “intention to adopt or accept.” The latter formulation is derived from the definition of “authenticate” in  Section 9-102(a)(7). This provision refers only to writings, because the term “signed,” as used in some articles, refers only to writings. This provision also makes it clear that, as the term “signed” is used in the Uniform Commercial Code, a complete signature is not necessary. The symbol may be printed, stamped or written; it may be by initials or by thumbprint. It may be on any part of the document and in appropriate cases may be found in a billhead or letterhead. No catalog of possible situations can be complete and the court must use common sense and commercial experience in passing upon these matters. The question always is whether the symbol was executed or adopted by the party with present intention to adopt or accept the writing.</p>
                <p>38. “State.” This is the standard definition of the term used in acts prepared by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</p>
                <p>39. “Surety.” This definition makes it clear that “surety” includes all secondary obligors, not just those whose obligation refers to the person obligated as a surety. As to the nature of secondary obligations generally, see  Restatement (Third), Suretyship and Guaranty Section 1 (1996).</p>
                <p>40. “Term.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>41. “Unauthorized signature.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>42. “Warehouse receipt.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201, which was derived from Section 76(1), Uniform Sales Act; Section 1, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act. Receipts issued by a field warehouse are included, provided the warehouseman and the depositor of the goods are different persons.</p>
                <p>43. “Written” or “writing.” Unchanged from former  Section 1-201.</p>

Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</p>

                <p><strong>Changes from former law:</strong> These provisions are substantive rather than purely definitional. Accordingly, they have been relocated from  Section 1-201 to this section. The reference to the “forgotten notice” doctrine has been deleted.</p>

                <p>3.

                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Source:</strong> Former  Section 1-201(37).</p>
                <p><strong>Changes from former law:</strong> This section is substantively identical to those portions of former  Section 1-201(37) that distinguished “true” leases from security interests, except that the definition of “present value” formerly embedded in  Section 1-201(37) has been placed in  Section 1-201(28).</p>
                <p>1. An interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation is a “security interest.” See  Section 1-201(37). Security interests are sometimes created by transactions in the form of leases. Because it can be difficult to distinguish leases that create security interests from those that do not, this section provides rules that govern the determination of whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest.</p>
                <p>2. One of the reasons it was decided to codify the law with respect to leases was to resolve an issue that created considerable confusion in the courts: what is a lease? The confusion existed, in part, due to the last two sentences of the definition of security interest in the 1978 Official Text of the Act,  Section 1-201(37). The confusion was compounded by the rather considerable change in the federal, state and local tax laws and accounting rules as they relate to leases of goods. The answer is important because the definition of lease determines not only the rights and remedies of the parties to the lease but also those of third parties. If a transaction creates a lease and not a security interest, the lessee’s interest in the goods is limited to its leasehold estate; the residual interest in the goods belongs to the lessor. This has significant implications to the lessee’s creditors. “On common law theory, the lessor, since he has not parted with title, is entitled to full protection against the lessee’s creditors and trustee in bankruptcy ____ ” 1 G. Gilmore,<em>Security Interests in Personal Property</em>Section 3.6, at 76 (1965).</p>
                <p>Under pre-UCC chattel security law there was generally no requirement that the lessor file the lease, a financing statement, or the like, to enforce the lease agreement against the lessee or any third party; the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9) did not change the common law in that respect. Coogan, Leasing and the Uniform Commercial Code, in<em>Equipment Leasing-Leveraged Leasingi.e., leases intended as security; however, the definition became vague and outmoded.</em>681, 700 n.25, 729 n.80 (2d ed. 1980). The Article on Leases (Article 2A) did not change the law in that respect, except for leases of fixtures. Section 2A-309. An examination of the common law will not provide an adequate answer to the question of what is a lease. The definition of security interest in  Section 1-201(37) of the 1978 Official Text of the Act provided that the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9) governs security interests disguised as leases,  </p>
                <p>Lease is defined in Article 2A as a transfer of the right to possession and use of goods for a term, in return for consideration. Section 2A-103(1)(j). The definition continues by stating that the retention or creation of a security interest is not a lease. Thus, the task of sharpening the line between true leases and security interests disguised as leases continues to be a function of this Article.</p>
                <p>This section begins where  Section 1-201(35) leaves off. It draws a sharper line between leases and security interests disguised as leases to create greater certainty in commercial transactions.</p>
                <p>Prior to enactment of the rules now codified in this section, the 1978 Official Text of  Section 1-201(37) provided that whether a lease was intended as security (<em>i.e.</em>, a security interest disguised as a lease) was to be determined from the facts of each case; however, (a) the inclusion of an option to purchase did not itself make the lease one intended for security, and (b) an agreement that upon compliance with the terms of the lease the lessee would become, or had the option to become, the owner of the property for no additional consideration, or for a nominal consideration, did make the lease one intended for security.</p>
                <p>Reference to the intent of the parties to create a lease or security interest led to unfortunate results. In discovering intent, courts relied upon factors that were thought to be more consistent with sales or loans than leases. Most of these criteria, however, were as applicable to true leases as to security interests. Examples include the typical net lease provisions, a purported lessor’s lack of storage facilities or its character as a financing party rather than a dealer in goods. Accordingly, this section contains no reference to the parties’ intent.</p>
                <p>Subsections (a) and (b) were originally taken from Section 1(2) of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act (act withdrawn 1943), modified to reflect current leasing practice. Thus, reference to the case law prior to the incorporation of those concepts in this article will provide a useful source of precedent. Gilmore,<em>Security Law, Formalism and Article 9e.g., In re Royer’s Bakery, Inc.In re Gehrke Enters.In re Celeryvale Transp.In re Berge, 32 Bankr. 370, 371-73 (Bankr.W.D.Wis. 1983)., 44 Bankr. 1007, 1014-15 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn. 1984). The fourth of these tests, subparagraph (4), is whether the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration. All of these tests focus on economics, not the intent of the parties.  , 1 Bankr. 647, 651-52 (Bankr.W.D.Wis. 1979). The third of these tests, subparagraph (3), is whether the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration, which is defined later in this section.  , 1 U.C.C. Rep.Serv. (Callaghan) 342 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. 1963)) and if one of four additional tests is met. The first of these four tests, subparagraph (1), is that the original lease term is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods. The second of these tests, subparagraph (2), is that the lessee is either bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or to become the owner of the goods.  </em>,  47 Neb.L.Rev. 659, 671 (1968). Whether a transaction creates a lease or a security interest continues to be determined by the facts of each case. Subsection (b) further provides that a transaction creates a security interest if the lessee has an obligation to continue paying consideration for the term of the lease, if the obligation is not terminable by the lessee (thus correcting early statutory gloss,  </p>
                <p>The focus on economics is reinforced by subsection (c). It states that a transaction does not create a security interest merely because the transaction has certain characteristics listed therein. Subparagraph (1) has no statutory derivative; it states that a full payout lease does not<em>per seRushton v. SheaCompare All- States Leasing Co. v. Ochswith In re TilleryCompare Arnold Mach. Co. v. BallsAoki v. Shepherd Mach. Co., 665 F.2d 941 (9th Cir.1982)., 624 P.2d 678 (Utah 1981), with  , 571 F.2d 1361 (5th Cir.1978). Subparagraph (4) restates and expands the provisions of the 1978 Official Text of  Section 1-201(37) to make clear that the option can be to buy or renew. Subparagraphs (5) and (6) treat fixed price options and provide that fair market value must be determined at the time the transaction is entered into.  , 42 Or.App. 319, 600 P.2d 899 (Ct.App. 1979),  , 419 F.Supp. 1349, 1365 (D.Del. 1976). Subparagraphs (2) and (3) provide the same regarding the provisions of the typical net lease.  </em>create a security interest.  </p>
                <p>The relationship of subsection (b) to subsection (c) deserves to be explored. The fixed price purchase option provides a useful example. A fixed price purchase option in a lease does not of itself create a security interest. This is particularly true if the fixed price is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed. A security interest is created only if the option price is nominal and the conditions stated in the introduction to the second paragraph of this subsection are met. There is a set of purchase options whose fixed price is less than fair market value but greater than nominal that must be determined on the facts of each case to ascertain whether the transaction in which the option is included creates a lease or a security interest.</p>
                <p>It was possible to provide for various other permutations and combinations with respect to options to purchase and renew. For example, this section could have stated a rule to govern the facts of<em>In re Marhoefer Packing Co.</em>, 674 F.2d 1139 (7th Cir.1982). This was not done because it would unnecessarily complicate the definition. Further development of this rule is left to the courts.</p>

                <p>Emerging Issues Analysis: Professor Margit Livingston on Putative Leases as Article 9 Secured Transactions. In most cases, filing a financing statement will protect the lessor/secured party from other secured parties. However, one type of transaction has bedeviled the courts for many years: the secured transaction disguised as a lease. Professor Livingston examines whether a corporation’s possessory repairman’s lien take priority over a lessor’s security interest.</p>

                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Source:</strong> Former  Section 1-201(44).</p>
                <p><strong>Changes from former law:</strong> Unchanged from former  Section 1-201, which was derived from Sections 25, 26, 27, 191, Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law; Section 76, Uniform Sales Act; Section 53, Uniform Bills of Lading Act; Section 58, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act; Section 22(1), Uniform Stock Transfer Act; Section 1, Uniform Trust Receipts Act. These provisions are substantive rather than purely definitional. Accordingly, they have been relocated from former  Section 1-201 to this section.</p>
                <p>1. All the Uniform Acts in the commercial law field (except the Uniform Conditional Sales Act) have carried definitions of “value.” All those definitions provided that value was any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract, including the taking of property in satisfaction of or as security for a pre-existing claim. Subsections (1), (2), and (4) in substance continue the definitions of “value” in the earlier acts. Subsection (3) makes explicit that “value” is also given in a third situation: where a buyer by taking delivery under a pre-existing contract converts a contingent into a fixed obligation.</p>
                <p>This definition is not applicable to Articles 3 and 4, but the express inclusion of immediately available credit as value follows the separate definitions in those Articles. See  Sections 4-208,  4-209,  3-303. A bank or other financing agency which in good faith makes advances against property held as collateral becomes a bona fide purchaser of that property even though provision may be made for charge-back in case of trouble. Checking credit is “immediately available” within the meaning of this section if the bank would be subject to an action for slander of credit in case checks drawn against the credit were dishonored, and when a charge-back is not discretionary with the bank, but may only be made when difficulties in collection arise in connection with the specific transaction involved.</p>

Former § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:1-206.html">28:1-206</a> concerned a statute of frauds for kinds of personal property not otherwise covered, was derived from Dec. 30, 1963, 77 Stat. 636, Pub. L. 88-243, § 1; Apr. 9, 1997, <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-240.html">D.C. Law 11-240</a>, § 3(c),  44 DCR 1087. The other articles of the Uniform Commercial Code make individual determinations as to requirements for memorializing transactions within their scope, so that the primary effect of former  Section 1-206 was to impose a writing requirement on sales transactions not otherwise governed by the UCC. Per the official commentary appearing under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:1-206.html">28:1-206</a>: “Deletion of former  Section 1-206 did not constitute a recommendation as to whether such sales transactions should be covered by a Statute of Frauds; rather, it reflected determination that there was no need for uniform commercial law to resolve that issue.”</p>
