In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine does not violate the bank’s prescribed procedures and the bank’s procedures do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this article or Article 4.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> “Party” means a party to an instrument.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(11)</span> “Promise” means a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay. An acknowledgment of an obligation by the obligor is not a promise unless the obligor also undertakes to pay the obligation.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(12)</span> “Prove” with respect to a fact means to meet the burden of establishing the fact under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:1-201.html">28:1-201</a>(b)(8).</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(13)</span> “Remitter” means a person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to an identified person other than the purchaser.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the term “negotiable instrument” means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Is payable on demand or at a definite time; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> “Instrument” means a negotiable instrument.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls within the definition of “check” in subsection (f) of this section is a negotiable instrument and a check.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this article.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> An instrument is a “note” if it is a promise and is a “draft” if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both “note” and “draft”, a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> “Check” means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or (ii) a cashier’s check or teller’s check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as “money order”.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> “Cashier’s check” means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> “Teller’s check” means a draft drawn by a bank on another bank, or payable at or through a bank.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> “Traveler’s check” means an instrument that (i) is payable on demand, (ii) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, (iii) is designated by the term “traveler’s check” or by a substantially similar term, and (iv) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> “Certificate of deposit” means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> “Issuer” applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Except as provided in this section, for the purposes of section 28:3-104(a), a promise or order is unconditional unless it states (i) an express condition to payment, (ii) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) that rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing. A reference to another writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A promise or order is not made conditional (i) by a reference to another record for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or acceleration, or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of section 28:3-104(a). If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of section 28:3-104(a); but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument. The instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than one person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by one or more of the signers.</p>

If an instrument is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the owner of the account identified by number.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If an instrument is payable to:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether or not the beneficiary or estate is also named;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A person described as agent or similar representative of a named or identified person, the instrument is payable to the represented person, the representative, or a successor of the representative;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> A fund or organization that is not a legal entity, the instrument is payable to a representative of the members of the fund or organization; or</p>
