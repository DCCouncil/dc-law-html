                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The following rules are subject to Article 4, agreement of the parties, and clearing-house rules and the like:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Presentment may be made at the place of payment of the instrument and must be made at the place of payment if the instrument is payable at a bank in the United States; may be made by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written, or electronic communication; is effective when the demand for payment or acceptance is received by the person to whom presentment is made; and is effective if made to any one of 2 or more makers, acceptors, drawees, or other payors.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is made, the person making presentment must (i) exhibit the instrument, (ii) give reasonable identification and, if presentment is made on behalf of another person, reasonable evidence of authority to do so, and (iii) sign a receipt on the instrument for any payment made or surrender the instrument if full payment is made.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Without dishonoring the instrument, the party to whom presentment is made may (i) return the instrument for lack of a necessary indorsement, or (ii) refuse payment or acceptance for failure of the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties, or other applicable law or rule.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The party to whom presentment is made may treat presentment as occurring on the next business day after the day of presentment if the party to whom presentment is made has established a cut-off hour not earlier than 2 p.m. for the receipt and processing of instruments presented for payment or acceptance and presentment is made after the cut-off hour.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Dishonor of a note is governed by the following rules:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the note is payable on demand, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made to the maker and the note is not paid on the day of presentment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If the note is not payable on demand and is payable at or through a bank or the terms of the note require presentment, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made and the note is not paid on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the note is not payable on demand and paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply, the note is dishonored if it is not paid on the day it becomes payable.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Dishonor of an unaccepted draft other than a documentary draft is governed by the following rules:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If a check is duly presented for payment to the payor bank otherwise than for immediate payment over the counter, the check is dishonored if the payor bank makes timely return of the check or sends timely notice of dishonor or nonpayment under section 28:4-301 or 28:4-302, or becomes accountable for the amount of the check under section 28:4-302.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If a draft is payable on demand and paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If a draft is payable on a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if (i) presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later, or (ii) presentment for acceptance is duly made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If a draft is payable on elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance, the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance is duly made and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Dishonor of an unaccepted documentary draft occurs according to the rules stated in subsection (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, except that payment or acceptance may be delayed without dishonor until no later than the close of the third business day of the drawee following the day on which payment or acceptance is required by those paragraphs.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Dishonor of an accepted draft is governed by the following rules:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If the draft is not payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> In any case in which presentment is otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused under section 28:3-504, dishonor occurs without presentment if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> If a draft is dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft was not made and the person entitled to demand acceptance consents to a late acceptance, from the time of acceptance the draft is treated as never having been dishonored.</p>

Return of an instrument given to a bank for collection is sufficient notice of dishonor.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Subject to section 28:3-504(c), with respect to an instrument taken for collection by a collecting bank, notice of dishonor must be given (i) by the bank before midnight of the next banking day following the banking day on which the bank receives notice of dishonor of the instrument, or (ii) by any other person within 30 days following the day on which the person receives notice of dishonor. With respect to any other instrument, notice of dishonor must be given within 30 days following the day on which dishonor occurs.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Notice of dishonor is excused if (i) by the terms of the instrument notice of dishonor is not necessary to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, or (ii) the party whose obligation is being enforced waived notice of dishonor. A waiver of presentment is also a waiver of notice of dishonor.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Delay in giving notice of dishonor is excused if the delay was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the person giving the notice and the person giving the notice exercised reasonable diligence after the cause of the delay ceased to operate.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The following are admissible as evidence and create a presumption of dishonor and of any notice of dishonor stated:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A document regular in form as provided in subsection (b) of this section which purports to be a protest;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A purported stamp or writing of the drawee, payor bank, or presenting bank on or accompanying the instrument stating that acceptance or payment has been refused unless reasons for the refusal are stated and the reasons are not consistent with dishonor;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> A book or record of the drawee, payor bank, or collecting bank, kept in the usual course of business which shows dishonor, even if there is no evidence of who made the entry.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A protest is a certificate of dishonor made by a United States consul or vice consul, or a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths by the law of the place where dishonor occurs. It may be made upon information satisfactory to that person. The protest must identify the instrument and certify either that presentment has been made or, if not made, the reason why it was not made, and that the instrument has been dishonored by nonacceptance or nonpayment. The protest may also certify that notice of dishonor has been given to some or all parties.</p>
