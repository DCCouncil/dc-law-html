Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer’s right to possession of the goods; but</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> tender to the buyer of a non-negotiable document of title or of a record directing to the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and except as otherwise provided in Article 9 receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer’s rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the non-negotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> he must tender all such documents in correct form except as provided in this article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of section 28:2-323); and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes non-acceptance or rejection.</p>
