No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Except as otherwise provided in section 28:9-406, unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor’s due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2A)</span> The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller’s interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer’s chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (a) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer; and (b) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of “the contract” is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor’s performance.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> An assignment of “the contract” or of “all my rights under the contract” or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (section 28:2-609).</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (section 28:2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this subtitle. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the article on secured transactions (Article 9), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> if the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such documents, and, if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer’s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this article, and in particular</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer’s right to possession of the goods; but</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> tender to the buyer of a non-negotiable document of title or of a record directing to the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and except as otherwise provided in Article 9 receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer’s rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the non-negotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> he must tender all such documents in correct form except as provided in this article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of section 28:2-323); and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes non-acceptance or rejection.</p>
