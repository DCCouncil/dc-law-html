                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">Each time a credit reporting agency provides a consumer with a copy of the consumer’s credit report under section 609 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, approved October 26, 1970 (84 Stat. 1131; 15 U.S.C. § 1681g  ), the credit reporting agency shall include the following notice with the credit report:</div>

                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">A security freeze is designed to help prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. To obtain a security freeze, you should contact each credit reporting agency. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, the credit reporting agency will send you a personal identification number or password to use if you later choose to lift the freeze from your credit report, or to authorize the release of your credit report to a specific party or parties, or for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the credit reporting agency and provide all of the following:</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">1. The unique personal identification number or password provided by the credit reporting agency.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">2. Verification of your identity.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">3. Information regarding who may receive the credit report or the period of time for which the report shall be made available.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">Upon receiving your proper request to lift temporarily a freeze from your credit report, the credit reporting agency shall comply within 3 business days. Beginning September 1, 2008, the credit reporting agency is required to provide methods, including web-based and telephonic methods, for you to request that the freeze be temporarily lifted within 15 minutes.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">A security freeze does not apply when you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control or similar activities.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">If you are actively seeking credit, the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and consider lifting a freeze — either completely if you are shopping around, or for a specific creditor before actually applying for new credit. Beginning September 1, 2008, you will be able to have a credit reporting agency temporarily lift a freeze on your credit report within 15 minutes of your request.</div>
                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.25em">You have a right to take legal action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws. The action can be brought against a credit reporting agency or anyone who fraudulently caused the release of your credit information.”.</div>
