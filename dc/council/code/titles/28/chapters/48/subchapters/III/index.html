                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date. An income receipt or disbursement shall be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins shall be allocated to principal and the balance must be allocated to income.</p>

Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28-4804.01.html">28-4804.01</a> applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> For the purposes of this section, the term “undistributed income” means net income received before the date on which an income interest ends. The term “undistributed income” does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> When a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary’s share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than 5 percent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends. In the latter case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked shall be added to principal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> When a trustee’s obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust’s assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if and to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate, or other tax requirements.</p>
