For the purposes of subsections (d), (d-1), (d-2), and (d-3) of this section, the term “payment” also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment.</p>

If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal.

If a payment is one of a series of payments that will result in the liquidation of the trust’s interest in the security over more than one accounting period, the trustee shall allocate 10 percent of the payment to income and the balance to principal.</p>
