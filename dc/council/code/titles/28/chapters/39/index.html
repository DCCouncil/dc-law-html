                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> A case is begun by filing with the Department a complaint plainly describing a trade practice and stating the complainant’s (and, if different, the consumer’s) name and address, the name and address (if known) of the respondent, and such other information as the Director may require. The complaint must be in or reduced by the Director to writing. The filing of a complaint with the Department shall toll the periods for limitation of time for bringing an action as set out in section 12-301 until the complaint has been resolved through an administrative order, consent decree, or dismissal in accordance with this section or until an opportunity to arbitrate has been provided in <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/code/titles/50/chapters/5/">Chapter 5 of Title 50</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> What trade practice actually occurred; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Whether the trade practice which occurred violates any statute, regulation, rule of common law, or other law of the District of Columbia.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If at any time the Director finds that the trade practice complained of may, in whole or in part, be a violation of law other than a law of the District of Columbia or a law within the jurisdiction of the Department, the Director may in writing so inform the complainant, respondent and officials of the District, the United States, or other jurisdiction, who would properly enforce such law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The Director shall determine that there are, or are not, reasonable grounds to believe that a trade practice, in violation of a law of the District of Columbia within the jurisdiction of the Department, has occurred in any part or all of the case.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> any violation of law which may have occurred is of a law not of the District of Columbia or not within the jurisdiction of the Department, or occurred more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d-1)">(d-1)</span> The Director may dismiss any part or all of a case to which one or more of the reasons stated in subsection (d) of this section apply. The Director shall inform all parties in writing of the determination, and, if any part or all of the case is dismissed, shall specify which of the reasons in this subsection applies to which part of the case, and such other detail as is necessary to explain the dismissal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The Director may attempt to settle, in accordance with subsection (h) of this section, each case for which reasonable grounds are found in accordance with subsection (d-1) of this section.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> effect a consent decree;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> dismiss the case in accordance with subsection (h)(2) of this section;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> through the Chief of the Office of Compliance present to the Office of Adjudication, with copies to all parties, a brief and plain statement of each trade practice that occurred in violation of District law, the law the trade practice violates, and the relief sought from the Office of Adjudication for violation; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> notify all parties of another action taken, with the reasons therefor stated in detail and supported by fact. Reasons may include:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> When the case is transmitted to the Office of Adjudication, the Chief of the Office of Compliance shall sign, and serve the respondent, the Department’s summons to answer or appear before the Office of Adjudication. Not less than 15 nor more than 90 days after such transmittal, the case shall be heard. The case shall proceed under section 10 of the District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act (section 2-509). The Office of Adjudication may, without delaying its hearing or decision, attempt to settle the case pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, and has discretion to permit any stipulation or consent decree the parties agree to. The Director shall be a party on behalf of the complainant. Applications to intervene shall be decided as may be proper or required by law or rule. Reasonable discovery shall be freely allowed. Any finding or decision may be modified or set aside, in whole or part, before a notice of appeal is filed in the case, or the time to so file has run out.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> If, after hearing the evidence, the Office of Adjudication decides a trade practice occurred in which the respondent violated a law of the District of Columbia within the jurisdiction of the Department, such Office of Adjudication shall issue an order which:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> shall require the respondent to cease and desist from such conduct;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> shall, if such Office of Adjudication also decides that the consumer has been injured by the trade practice, order redress through contract damages, restitution for money, time, property or other value received from the consumer by the respondent, or through rescission, reformation, repair, replacement, or other just method;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> shall state the number of trade practices the respondent performed in violation of law;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(5)">(5)</span> may include such other findings, stipulations, conditions, directives, and remedies including punitive damages, treble damages, or reasonable attorney’s fees, as are reasonable and necessary to identify, correct, or prevent the conduct which violated District law; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(6)">(6)</span> may be based, in whole or part, upon a violation of a law establishing or regulating a type of business, occupational or professional license or permit, and may refer the case for further proceedings to an appropriate board or commission, but may not suspend or revoke a license or permit if there is a board or commission which oversees the specific type of license or permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)">(1)</span> At any time after reasonable grounds are found in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, the respondent, the Department (represented by (i) the Director prior to transmittal to the Office of Adjudication and after an order issued pursuant to subsection (f) of this section has been appealed, and (ii) the Office of Adjudication after transmittal to the Office of Adjudication and prior to such appeal), and the complainant, may agree to settle all or part of the case by a written consent decree which may:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)(A)">(A)</span> include any provision described in subsection (g)(2) through (6) of this section;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> The representative of the Department shall administer the settlement proceedings, and may utilize the good offices of the Advisory Committee on Consumer Protection. All settlement proceedings shall be informal and include all interested parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to represent them. Such proceedings shall be private, and nothing said or done, except a consent decree, shall be made public by the Department, any party, or the Advisory Committee, unless the parties agree thereto in writing. The representative of the Department may call settlement conferences. For persistent and unreasonable failure by the complainant to attend such conferences or to take part in other settlement proceedings, the Director, prior to transmittal to the Office of Adjudication, may dismiss the case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(3)">(3)</span> A consent decree described in paragraph (1) of this subsection may be modified by agreement of the Department, complainant and respondent.</p>
