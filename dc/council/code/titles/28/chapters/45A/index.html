                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> “Cash and carry” means the purchaser is responsible for the transportation of a purchased article or product to the purchaser’s designated destination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> “Cigarettes” means any size or shaped roll for smoking that is made of tobacco or tobacco mixed with another ingredient and wrapped in paper or in any other material except tobacco. The term “cigarettes” does not include cigars.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> “Cost” means the invoice or replacement cost, whichever is lower, of cigarettes to the retailer or wholesaler, plus:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(C)">(C)</span> In the absence of proof of the cost of doing business, a markup of 8% on the total of the invoice or replacement cost shall be <em>prima facie</em> proof of the cost of doing business with regard to cigarettes being sold at retail. With regard to any determination of the cost of cigarettes to a wholesaler or retailer, the surtax imposed by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2402.html">47-2402</a> shall not be considered in determining the cost of the articles or products.</p>
                <p>With regard to any determination of the cost of cigarettes to a wholesaler or retailer, a fractional part of a cent equal to 1/10 of 1% or more shall be rounded off to the next higher cent. Except as provided in § 28-4522, discounts granted for cash payments or electronic fund transfers shall not be used to reduce cost determinations.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding § 28-4522, articles or products given gratis or payments made to a retailer or wholesaler for display, advertising, or promotion purposes shall not be considered in determining the cost of the articles or products.</p>
