                <h4>References in Text</h4>
                <p>The title of Secretary of War was changed to Secretary of the Army by § 205(a) of the Act of July 26, 1947, 61 Stat. 501, ch. 343. Section 205(a) of the Act of July 26, 1947, was repealed by § 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, 70A Stat. 641, ch. 1041.</p>
                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Restriction on use of funds: Section 136 of Pub. L. 102-382, 106 Stat. 1435, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1993, provided that none of the funds made available in this Act may be used by the District of Columbia to impose, implement, collect, administer, transfer, or enforce a payment in lieu of taxes on the Water and Sewer Utility Administration that would increase payments required of suburban jurisdictions in Maryland or Virginia under the Blue Plains Intermunicipal Agreement of 1985.</p>
                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
