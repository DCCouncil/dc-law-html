For the purpose of determining whether the gas manufactured, distributed, or sold by such persons or corporations for lighting, heating, or power purposes conforms to the standards of illuminating power, purity, and pressure, and for the purpose of determining whether the efficiency of the electric transmission or distribution system conforms to the orders issued by the Commission, the Commission shall have power, of its own motion, to examine and investigate the plants and methods employed in manufacturing, delivering, and supplying gas or transmitting or distributing electricity, and shall have access, through it members or persons employed and authorized by it to make such examinations and investigations, to all parts of the manufacturing plants owned, used, or operated for the manufacture, transmission, or distribution of gas or the transmission or distribution of electricity by any such person or corporation.
