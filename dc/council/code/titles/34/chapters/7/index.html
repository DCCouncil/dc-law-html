In construing and enforcing the provisions of this section, the act, omission, or failure of any officer, agent, or other person acting for or employed by any public utility acting within the scope of his employment and instructions shall in every case be deemed to be the act, omission, or failure of such public utility.</p>

In determining the amount of such penalty, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the gravity of the violation, and the good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation, shall be considered. The amount of such penalty when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the District of Columbia to the person charged or may be recovered in a civil action in the District of Columbia courts.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The public utility’s good-faith attempt to achieve compliance with the regulations.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> A penalty imposed under this subsection shall not be passed on to ratepayers in rates or in any other manner by the public utility.</p>
