If within 20 business days following such written notification the cable operator has not furnished proof that corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued to the satisfaction of the Executive Director, or that the alleged violation did not occur, the Executive Director, through the Mayor, shall submit a resolution for termination of the franchise to the Council.</p>
