                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Fund shall be used solely for the purposes of this chapter.</p>

All DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Revenue so collected, wherever held or deposited and whether having been remitted to the trustee or not, shall automatically be pledged at the time of receipt to the repayment of the Bonds pursuant to this chapter and the indenture. The electric company shall have no rights in or to the DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Revenue. The sole responsibility of the electric company shall be to act in an agency capacity for the collection of the DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Revenue and to remit the DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Revenue to a trustee in accordance with the servicing agreement. In the event of the electric company’s failure to collect and remit the DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Revenue to the trustee, the District may remove the electric company under and in accordance with the servicing agreement, but the District shall have no recourse against the assets of the electric company.
