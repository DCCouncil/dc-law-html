                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> It is the intent of the District of Columbia to exercise its statutory option under the federal legislation by opting in to its interstate branching schemata thus permitting the District’s Office of Banking and Financial Institutions to regulate, pursuant to the federal legislation, interstate branching, acquisition of branches, bank mergers, and consolidations of existing banking entities within the District of Columbia among other things.</p>
