The surety on the bond shall have the right to cancel such bond upon giving 30 days written notice to the Superintendent [Commissioner] and thereafter shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after the effective date of the cancellation.  Any license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be revoked, and void, by operation of law during any period when the bond required by this section is not in full force and effect.</p>

The licensee shall comply with the order within 20 days following service of the order upon the licensee.</p>
