                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If any person tried upon an indictment or information for an offense raises the defense of insanity and is acquitted solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission, he shall be committed to a hospital for the mentally ill until such time as he is eligible for release pursuant to this subsection or subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A person confined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall have a hearing, unless waived, within 50 days of his confinement to determine whether he is entitled to release from custody. At the conclusion of the criminal action referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall provide such person with representation by counsel:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> In the case of a person who is eligible to have counsel appointed by the court, by continuing any appointment of counsel made to represent such person in the prior criminal action or by appointing new counsel; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> In the case of a person who is not eligible to have counsel appointed by the court, by assuring representation by retained counsel.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> If the hearing is not waived, the court shall cause notice of the hearing to be served upon the person, his counsel, and the prosecuting attorney and hold the hearing. Within 10 days from the date the hearing was begun, the court shall determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. The person confined shall have the burden of proof. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person confined is entitled to his release from custody, either conditional or unconditional, the court shall enter such order as may appear appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> An appeal may be taken from an order entered upon paragraph (2) of this subsection to the court having jurisdiction to review final judgments of the court entering the order.</p>

The court shall weigh the evidence and, if the court finds that such person has recovered his sanity and will not in the reasonable future be dangerous to himself or others, the court shall order such person unconditionally released from further confinement in said hospital. If the court does not so find, the court shall order such person returned to said hospital. Where, in the judgment of the superintendent of such hospital, a person confined under subsection (d) of this section is not in such condition as to warrant his unconditional release, but is in a condition to be conditionally released under supervision, and such certificate is filed and served as above provided, such certificate shall be sufficient to authorize the court to order the release of such person under such conditions as the court shall see fit at the expiration of 15 days from the time such certificate is filed and served pursuant to this section; provided, that the provisions as to hearing prior to unconditional release shall also apply to conditional releases, and, if, after a hearing and weighing the evidence, the court shall find that the condition of such person warrants his conditional release, the court shall order his release under such conditions as the court shall see fit, or, if the court does not so find, the court shall order such person returned to such hospital.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, when an accused person is acquitted solely on the ground of insanity and ordered confined in a hospital for the mentally ill, the person and the person’s estate shall be charged with the expense of the person’s support in the hospital.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The District shall not charge a person or his estate for the expense of the person’s support in a hospital for the mentally ill if the source of the funds being sought to compensate the District were obtained as a result of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A judgment against the District pertaining to its care of the person; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A settlement reached by the District with a person or his estate pertaining to its care of the person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> Nothing herein contained shall preclude a person confined under the authority of this section from establishing his eligibility for release under the provisions of this section by a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The provisions of this section shall supersede in the District of Columbia the provisions of any federal statutes or parts thereof inconsistent with this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> When a person has been ordered confined in a hospital for the mentally ill pursuant to this section and has escaped from such hospital, the court which ordered confinement shall, upon request of the government, order the return of the escaped person to such hospital. The return order shall be effective throughout the United States. Any federal judicial officer within whose jurisdiction the escaped person shall be found shall, upon receipt of the return order issued by the committing court, cause such person to be apprehended and delivered up for return to such hospital.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> Insanity shall not be a defense in any criminal proceeding in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, unless the accused or his attorney in such proceeding, at the time the accused enters his plea of not guilty, or within 15 days thereafter, or at such later time as the court may for good cause permit, files with the court and serves upon the prosecuting attorney written notice of his intention to rely on such defense. No person accused of an offense shall be acquitted on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission unless his insanity, regardless of who raises the issue, is affirmatively established by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A person in custody or conditionally released from custody, pursuant to the provisions of this section, claiming the right to be released from custody, the right to any change in the conditions of his release, or other relief concerning his custody, may move the court having jurisdiction to order his release, to release him from custody, to change the conditions of his release, or to grant other relief.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A motion for relief may be made at any time after a hearing has been held or waived pursuant to subsection (d)(2) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the person is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the prosecuting authority, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues, and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. On all issues raised by his motion, the person shall have the burden of proof. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person is entitled to his release from custody, either conditional or unconditional, a change in the conditions of his release, or other relief, the court shall enter such order as may appear appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A court may entertain and determine the motion without requiring the production of the persons at the hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> A court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for relief under this section more often than once every 6 months. A court for good cause shown may in its discretion entertain such a motion more often than once every 6 months.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> An appeal may be taken from an order entered under this section to the court having jurisdiction to review final judgments of the court entering the order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> An application for habeas corpus on behalf of a person who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court having jurisdiction to entertain a motion pursuant to this section, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of his detention.</p>
