The court shall weigh the evidence and, if the court finds that such person has recovered his sanity and will not in the reasonable future be dangerous to himself or others, the court shall order such person unconditionally released from further confinement in said hospital. If the court does not so find, the court shall order such person returned to said hospital. Where, in the judgment of the superintendent of such hospital, a person confined under subsection (d) of this section is not in such condition as to warrant his unconditional release, but is in a condition to be conditionally released under supervision, and such certificate is filed and served as above provided, such certificate shall be sufficient to authorize the court to order the release of such person under such conditions as the court shall see fit at the expiration of 15 days from the time such certificate is filed and served pursuant to this section; provided, that the provisions as to hearing prior to unconditional release shall also apply to conditional releases, and, if, after a hearing and weighing the evidence, the court shall find that the condition of such person warrants his conditional release, the court shall order his release under such conditions as the court shall see fit, or, if the court does not so find, the court shall order such person returned to such hospital.</p>

                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/15-358.html">D.C. Law 15-358</a> repealed subsecs. (a), (a-1), and (b) which had read as follows:</p>
                <p>“(a) If it appears to a court having jurisdiction of: (1) a person arrested, or indicted for, or charged by information with, an offense; or (2) a child subject to a transfer motion in the Family Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-2307.html">16-2307</a>, that, from the court’s own observations or from prima facie evidence submitted to it and prior to the imposition of sentence, the expiration of any period of probation, or the hearing on the transfer motion, as the case may be, such person or child (hereafter in this subsection and subsection (b) of this section referred to as the ‘accused’) is of unsound mind or is mentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense, the court may order the accused committed to the District of Columbia General Hospital or other mental hospital designated by the court, for such reasonable period as the court may determine for examination and observation and for care and treatment if such is necessary by the psychiatric staff of said hospital. If, after such examination and observation, the superintendent of the hospital, in the case of a mental hospital, or the chief psychiatrist of the District of Columbia General Hospital, in the case of District of Columbia General Hospital, shall report that in his opinion the accused is of unsound mind or mentally incompetent, such report shall be sufficient to authorize the court to commit by order the accused to a hospital for the mentally ill unless the accused or the government objects, in which event the court, after hearing without a jury, shall make a judicial determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial or to participate in transfer proceedings. If the court shall find the accused to be then of unsound mind or mentally incompetent to stand trial or to participate in transfer proceedings, the court shall order the accused confined to a hospital for the mentally ill.</p>
                <p>“(a-1)(1) If the court determines after a hearing, or pursuant to a report of the superintendent of the hospital to which neither party objects, that the accused person is mentally incompetent to stand trial or to participate in transfer proceedings, and not likely to regain such competence in the reasonable future, and, if after a petition has been filed pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-541.html">21-541</a>, the court further determines that the person shall be released from further detention in the criminal or transfer proceeding, the court shall remand the person to the hospital and the hospital may detain the person pending a hearing on the petition conducted pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-542.html">21-542</a>. Within 7 days of the remand order, a person so detained may request a probable cause hearing before the Family Court of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-525.html">21-525</a> on the person’s continued hospitalization, in which case a hearing shall be held within 24 hours after the receipt of the request.</p>
                <p>“(2) If the court determines that the accused person shall be released from further detention in the criminal or transfer proceeding, but a petition has not been filed pursuant to D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-541.html">21-541</a>, the court may stay the person’s release for a period not to exceed 48 hours and remand the person to the hospital for the period of the stay so that the superintendent of the hospital may have an opportunity to initiate proceedings for the person’s hospitalization under subchapter III of Chapter 5 of Title 21.</p>
                <p>“(b) Whenever an accused person confined to a hospital for the mentally ill is restored to mental competency in the opinion of the superintendent of said hospital, the superintendent shall certify such fact to the clerk of the court in which the indictment, information, or charge against the accused is pending and such certification shall be sufficient to authorize the court to enter an order thereon adjudicating him to be competent to stand trial or to participate in transfer proceedings, unless the accused or the government objects, in which event, the court, after hearing without a jury, shall make a judicial determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial or to participate in transfer proceedings.”</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/17-150.html">D.C. Law 17-150</a> rewrote subsec. (f), which had read as follows: “(f) When an accused person shall be acquitted solely on the ground of insanity and ordered confined in a hospital for the mentally ill, such person and his estate shall be charged with the expense of his support in such hospital.”</p>

                <p>Section 2 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/14-311.html">D.C. Law 14-311</a> amended the section by adding subsec. (a-1) to read as follows:</p>
                <p>“(a-1)(1) If the court determines after a hearing, or pursuant to a report of the superintendent of the hospital to which neither party objects, that the accused person is mentally incompetent to stand trial or to participate in transfer proceedings, and not likely to regain such competence in the reasonable future, and, if after a petition has been filed pursuant to D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-541.html">21-541</a>, the court further determines that the person shall be released from further detention in the criminal or transfer proceeding, the court shall remand the person to the hospital and the hospital may detain the person pending a hearing on the petition conducted pursuant to D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-542.html">21-542</a>. Within 7 days of the remand order, a person so detained may request a probable cause hearing before the Family Court of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia under D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-525.html">21-525</a> on the person’s continued hospitalization, in which case a hearing shall be held within 24 hours after the receipt of the request.</p>
                <p>“(2) If the court determines that the accused person shall be released from further detention in the criminal or transfer proceeding, but a petition has not been filed pursuant to D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-541.html">21-541</a>, the court may stay the person’s release for a period not to exceed 48 hours and remand the person to the hospital for the period of the stay so that the superintendent of the hospital may have an opportunity to initiate proceedings for the person’s hospitalization under subchapter III of Chapter 5 of Title 21 of the District of Columbia Official Code.”</p>
                <p>Section 4(b) of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/14-311.html">D.C. Law 14-311</a> provided that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
                <p>Section 2 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/15-165.html">D.C. Law 15-165</a> added subsec. (a-1) to read as follows:</p>
