                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="I(a)">(a)</span> The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="I(b)">(b)</span> It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="I(b)(1)">(1)</span> Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="I(b)(5)">(5)</span> Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="I(b)(6)">(6)</span> Equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="I(b)(7)">(7)</span> Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or other criminal or juvenile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="I(b)(10)">(10)</span> Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="I(b)(11)">(11)</span> Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="I(c)">(c)</span> It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission, created in Article III of this compact, are the formation of public policies and, therefore, are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="III(b)">(b)</span> The Interstate Commission shall consist of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state, in consultation with the State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision (“State Council”). The commissioner shall be the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator, or designee from that state who shall serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to the applicable law of the compacting state.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="III(c)">(c)</span> In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the Interstate Commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners but who are members of interested organizations.
