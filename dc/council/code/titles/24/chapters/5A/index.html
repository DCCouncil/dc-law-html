                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The Court determines that the government’s interest in bringing the defendant to trial or proceeding with sentencing, probation revocation, or transfer outweighs the defendant’s interest in refusing medication to render him or her competent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In making the determination required by paragraph 1(B) of this subsection, the court must find that:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The administration of medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The administration of medication is substantially unlikely to have side effects that will significantly interfere with the defendant’s ability to assist counsel in conducting a defense;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Involuntary medication is necessary to further the government’s interest because any less intrusive treatments alternatives are unlikely to render the defendant competent; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The administration of medication is medically appropriate.</p>
