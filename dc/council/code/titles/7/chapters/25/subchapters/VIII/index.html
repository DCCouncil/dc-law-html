                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Order the gun offender to report to the Chief to register as required by this subchapter; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Court shall provide to the Chief, and to the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, a copy of the certification and order, and such other records and information in its possession that will assist in the registration of the gun offender.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> In any case where the Court orders the release of a gun offender into the community following a period of detention, incarceration, confinement, civil commitment, or hospitalization, the Court shall provide the gun offender with a copy of the order required under subsection (a) of this section and require the gun offender to read, or have read to him or her, and sign the copy of the order.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The certification and order shall be personally served upon the person, at which time the requirements of this subchapter shall apply, unless that person moves the Court to rescind the certification and order and the Court grants the motion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Agencies in the District of Columbia to which the probation, parole, supervised release, or conditional release of a gun offender is transferred from another jurisdiction are authorized to inform the Chief of that transfer of supervision for purposes of implementing the provisions of subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Notwithstanding the court certification requirements of this subchapter, any person convicted of a gun offense in any jurisdiction other than the District of Columbia who is ordered by competent authority in that jurisdiction to register as a gun offender in the District of Columbia shall comply with the registration and other requirements of this subchapter.</p>
