                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Department shall not be required to investigate a report that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Fails to allege facts that, if proved, would be sufficient to support the conclusion that the alleged victim is an “adult in need of protective services” as that term is defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1901.html">7-1901</a>(2); or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Is substantively repetitive of a previously reported incidence of abuse, neglect, or exploitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If a report alleges the existence of an immediate, substantial risk of life-threatening harm to an adult in need of protective services, the Department shall immediately notify the police, who shall conduct a prompt investigation to determine the need for police intervention. In addition, within 24 hours of the Department’s receiving such a report, an APS worker shall commence an investigation to determine the need for protective services. These 2 investigations may be conducted either jointly or separately.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> For reports that allege an adult is in need of protective services but do not allege the existence of an immediate, substantial risk of life-threatening harm, an APS worker shall commence an investigation to determine the need for protective services within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) of the Department’s receiving the report.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> In accordance with procedures to be established under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1909.html">7-1909</a>(1), the Mayor shall ensure that, when appropriate, an APS worker is accompanied by a police officer while conducting an initial or follow-up investigation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Before entering a residence or otherwise approaching an adult who is allegedly in need of protective services, an APS worker conducting an investigation under this section shall first announce his or her purpose and, if accompanied by a police officer, the presence of that officer, and then secure the consents of the adult allegedly in need of protective services and any other adult who is present and appears to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the residence or immediate premises. If the adult allegedly in need of protective services objects to the investigation and it does not manifestly appear to the APS worker that the objection is prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another or that the adult is incapacitated, the investigation shall be terminated. If the objection manifestly appears prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another, or if another person on the premises refuses to allow the investigation to take place, the Department may, either on its own behalf or, if the APS worker is employed by an agency other than the Department, on behalf of the other investigating agency, request the Attorney General to petition for an ex parte order pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. Where good cause exists to believe that a self-neglecting person is incapacitated, the APS worker, the Department, or the Attorney General may provide protective services pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1905.html">7-1905</a>(c-1).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If requested by the Department, the Attorney General shall promptly conduct a factual inquiry and, if legally supportable, file a petition in court for an ex parte order enjoining persons other than the adult who is allegedly in need of protective services from directly or indirectly interfering with the investigation. The petition shall allege specific facts, supported by oath or affirmation, showing that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> There is probable cause to believe an adult located at a specified location is in need of protective services; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> An APS worker conducting an investigation was denied reasonable access to the adult by a 3rd person, or, if the adult objected to the investigation, there is probable cause to believe the objection was prompted by fear or intimidation instilled by another.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If the court finds that a proper showing has been made under subsection (c) (1) and (2) of this section, it shall enjoin the appropriate 3rd person(s) from interfering with an investigation under this section. The court may also order any other relief deemed necessary to facilitate an investigation, but in so doing it shall fully respect the right of an adult who is allegedly in need of protective services to freely object to and terminate that investigation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The scope of an investigation under this section shall be only that which is minimally necessary for an APS worker to determine whether an adult is in need of protective services, and, if so, what protective services are needed to remedy or substantially reduce the likelihood of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation by others.</p>

Notice shall be effected by personal service, substitute service on a person of suitable age and discretion at the usual place of abode or employment of the person to be notified, or registered or certified mail. Pursuant to rules to be established by the court, subpoenas shall issue directing the appearance of persons whose presence at the hearing is essential to the relief sought in the petition. The adult in need of protective services and any other person on whom notice is served under this subsection shall have the right to retain counsel, and if indigent, to have counsel promptly appointed by the court upon the Attorney General’s filing of a petition under subsection (a) of this section. Every effort shall be made to secure the presence of the adult in need of protective services at the hearing; failure of the adult to appear shall be explained by his or her counsel to the satisfaction of the court. All parties to the proceeding may present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Testimony of the person(s) allegedly responsible for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation, and the fruits of that testimony, shall be inadmissible as evidence in a subsequent criminal trial except in a prosecution for perjury or false statement.</p>

Publicly funded or pro bono legal services shall be considered and given priority by the court. If such services are unavailable, compensation for appointed counsel shall be at the hourly rate established pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/11-2604.html">11-2604</a>(a), and, unless expressly waived by the court, shall be subject to a maximum amount of $750 per proceeding. Counsel shall also be reimbursed for expenses reasonably incurred. Compensation for investigative, expert, and other services shall be in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/11-2605.html">11-2605</a>. This subsection shall be implemented pursuant to procedures established by the court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If the court finds that the Attorney General has proven the averments in the petition by a preponderance of the evidence, it may:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Direct any person to refrain from abusing, neglecting, exploiting, directly or indirectly interfering with the provision of services to, residing with, or otherwise contacting the adult in need of protective services;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Direct a caregiver to fulfill his, her, or its legal or contractual responsibilities, or to refrain from inadequately carrying out voluntarily assumed responsibilities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Direct the Mayor to petition for the appointment of a conservator or guardian;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Direct the Mayor to provide specified or unspecified protective services, including at night and on weekends if necessary; provided, that the court shall not direct the Mayor to provide a type of service not otherwise made available by the District government;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Direct the Mayor, a caregiver, or, when appropriate, another party to the proceeding to remove the adult in need of protective services to a hospital, nursing home, community residence facility, hospice, or other appropriate facility (except a facility or part of a facility that has as its principal purpose the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses and disorders), so long as the placement is the least restrictive setting available in which the adult’s needs can be adequately met;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Direct any person to pay or reimburse the District, in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1910.html">7-1910</a>, for relief granted under paragraph (4) or (5) of this subsection; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Direct any combination of the above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> When granting relief under subsection (d)(3) through (5) of this section, the court shall first consider those remedies that encourage maximum self-determination and are least restrictive of personal liberty. In so doing, the court shall adopt a strong, rebuttable presumption in favor of home care over institutionalization. Secondarily, the court shall inquire about and take into consideration potential expense to the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The court may modify or rescind a provisional protection order upon the motion of any party to the original proceeding and for good cause shown. Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, a provisional protection order granting the relief in subsection (d)(4) or (5) of this section shall remain effective as to that relief for such period up to 45 calendar days as the court may specify, except that on the motion of any party to the original proceeding and for good cause shown, the court may grant a single extension for a period not to exceed an additional 45 calendar days. This 90-day time limitation may not be circumvented by the attempted issuance of a new order or reissuance of the original order before or after the extension period has expired. Relief granted under subsection (d)(1) through (3) and (6) of this section shall remain effective for such period as the court may specify.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> When determining the duration of a provisional protection order that directs the Mayor to provide protective services, the court shall take into account the number of days, if any, that the District has already provided services pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1905.html">7-1905</a>(a) or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1907.html">7-1907</a>, and in no event shall the issuance of a protection order result in the District’s being required to provide more than 90 days of services in any particular case.</p>
