            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The current system of treating substance abusers in the District does not serve the needs of the community. There are between 65,000 and 100,000 persons in the District who need treatment for substance abuse. In the first 11 months of FY1999, the Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration (“APRA”) served only 5,700 clients. No statistics are available regarding whether these individuals were successfully treated. Among other things, too few detoxification services slots create a bottleneck in its treatment programs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The financial costs associated with substance abuse are enormous. According to some estimates, these costs probably exceed $1 billion in the District for health care expenditures, premature death, impaired productivity, motor vehicle crashes, crime, and social welfare cases due to alcohol and drug abuse. For every $1 spent on substance abuse treatment an average of $7 is saved in costs associated with criminal justice, health care and social services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Even more critical are the tragic human costs associated with substance abuse. Substance abuse is a major factor in crime, domestic violence, child abuse, joblessness, emergency room visits, AIDS cases, and public health in the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> In the District, the human costs are pervasive and devastating. Sixty-seven percent of recent offenders in the District tested positive in at least half of all drug tests. Similarly, 69% of APRA’s clients have an arrest record. Eighty-five percent of child protection cases, 75% of foster care cases, and 35% of AIDS cases are related to drug abuse. Moreover, one in 7 mothers delivering babies test positive for drug use as well; 38% of emergency room visit patients are under the influence of alcohol. Finally, up to 50% of perpetrators of domestic violence have substance abuse problems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Access to meaningful treatment is clearly a major hurdle to recovery. Seventy-nine percent of APRA’s clients were unemployed and had no insurance. Importantly, while 19.2% of APRA’s clients are eligible for Medicaid, APRA does not access Medicaid dollars for outpatient and residential treatment services. This oversight results is the loss of millions of dollars for such services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The existing programs offered by APRA are insufficient. Sixty percent of substance abusers have psychiatric disorders, but only a fraction of those receive treatment. The Latino community is underserved because of the lack of bilingual residential treatment programs. Additionally, existing services fail to meet the treatment needs of youth, the elderly, pregnant and parenting women, and persons with disabilities.</p>

Except as provided in subsection (a-1) of this section, the Fund shall be comprised of general revenue funds appropriated by a line item in the budget submitted pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-204.46.html">1-204.46</a>, and authorized by Congress in an appropriations act for the purpose of the Drug Treatment Choice Program.  The Mayor shall, subject to authorization by Congress in an appropriations act, deposit in the Fund any and all other funds received on behalf of the Fund for the purpose of the Drug Treatment Choice Program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> All funds shall be deposited into the Fund without regard to fiscal year limitation pursuant to an act of Congress. All funds deposited into the Fund shall not revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of any fiscal year or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the purpose of the Drug Treatment Choice Program, subject to authorization by Congress in an appropriations act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span> There is established within the Fund a segregated account to be known as the ATR Account, into which shall be deposited the federal grant funds awarded to APRA for ATR, to be expended solely for the purposes of ATR, in accordance with federal requirements and regulations promulgated to implement this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Except as provided in subsection (a-1) of this section, the Fund shall be used only for payments directly to treatment providers. The Fund shall be the sole source for payments to treatment providers under the Drug Treatment Choice Program. APRA shall administer the Drug Treatment Choice Program and the Fund from APRA’s appropriated operating budget.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Within 18 months of July 18, 2000, APRA shall develop a plan to incorporate all APRA funding for substance abuse treatment services into the Fund. APRA may propose to continue then existing contracts and grants upon a finding that the Program would not serve the specific needs of a particular clientele or group.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The plan developed by APRA pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be submitted by the Mayor to the Council for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed plan, in whole or in part, by resolution within this 45-day review period, the proposed plan shall be deemed approved.</p>
