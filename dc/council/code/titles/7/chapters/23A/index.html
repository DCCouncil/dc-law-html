              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>The Mayor is hereby authorized to execute, on behalf of the District of Columbia, the Emergency Management Assistance Compact in the form substantially as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states that enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the Governor (Mayor) of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivision of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency period. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> On behalf of the Governor (Mayor) of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resources shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Review party states’ individual emergency plans and develop a plan that will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and deliver [sic] of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.<em>sic</em></p>
                <p>
                  <em>sic</em>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this compact shall apply only to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within 30 days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party’s response and a point of contact at that location.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor of the party state, or the Mayor of the District of Columbia, that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state(s), whichever is longer.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but such withdrawal shall not take effect until 30 days after the Governor of the withdrawing state, or the Mayor of the District of Columbia, has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the Governors of all other party states (or to the Mayor of the District of Columbia). Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each party state and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government.</p>
