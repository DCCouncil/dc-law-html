                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>
       Applicability of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-168.html">D.C. Law 21-168</a>: <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-168.html#§4">§ 4 of D.C. Law 21-168</a> provided that the creation of this section by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-168.html#§2">§ 2 of D.C. Law 21-168</a> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore the change made to this section by that amendment has been delayed.
