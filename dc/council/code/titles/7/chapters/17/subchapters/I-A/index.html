                <p>For the purposes of this subchapter, the term:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> "Tobacco product" means any product that is made from or derived from tobacco and is intended for human consumption or is likely to be consumed, whether smoked, heated, chewed, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled, or ingested by any other means, including through a cigarette, a cigar, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, snus, smokeless tobacco, or an electronic smoking device, as that term is defined in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-741.01.html#(1)">§ 7-741.01(1)</a>. The term "tobacco product" also includes any component or accessory used in the consumption of a tobacco product, such as filters, rolling papers, pipes, or liquids used in electronic smoking devices. The term "tobacco product" does not include drugs, devices, or combination products authorized for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration, as those terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, approved June 25, 1938 (52 Stat. 1040; 21 U.S.C. § 301 <em>et seq</em>.).

A display case that holds tobacco products behind locked doors does not constitute a self-service display.</p>
