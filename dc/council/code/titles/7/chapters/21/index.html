Each ITP shall be jointly formulated and approved by the Department of Human Services (“DHS”) and the District of Columbia Public Schools (“DCPS”) no later than 30 days after a child is determined to be in need of therapeutic care. As required by 20 U.S.C. § 1401 et seq., a resident with a disability receiving therapeutic care and in need of special education shall also have a current individualized education program (“IEP”).</p>

With the exception of foster homes, each facility providing emergency or continuing care to a District child outside the District shall submit to the monitoring committee quarterly reports on that child’s physical, emotional, and educational development.</p>

If the committee finds that a child’s current placement is inadequate, that a child’s ITP or IEP needs revision, or that a required aftercare plan is lacking, it shall within 15 days report its findings and recommendations to the Director of DHS and the Superintendent of Schools.
