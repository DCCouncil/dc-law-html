                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> It is the intent of the Council of the District of Columbia to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Assure that residents of the District of Columbia with intellectual disabilities shall have all the civil and legal rights enjoyed by all other citizens of the District of Columbia and the United States;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Secure for each resident of the District of Columbia with intellectual disabilities, regardless of ability to pay, such habilitation as will be suited to the needs of the person, and to assure that such habilitation is skillfully and humanely provided with full respect for the person’s dignity and personal integrity and in a setting least restrictive of personal liberty;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Encourage and promote the development of the ability and potential of each person with intellectual disabilities in the District to the fullest possible extent, no matter how severe his or her degree of disability;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Promote the economic security, standard of living and meaningful employment of persons with intellectual disabilities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Maximize the assimilation of persons with intellectual disabilities into the ordinary life of the community in which they live; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Provide a mechanism for the identification of persons with intellectual disabilities at the earliest age possible.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> To accomplish these purposes, the Council of the District of Columbia finds and declares that the design and delivery of care and habilitation services for persons with intellectual disabilities shall be directed by the principles of normalization, and therefore:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Community-based services and residential facilities that are least restrictive to the personal liberty of the individual shall be established for persons with intellectual disabilities at each stage of life development;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The use of institutionalization shall be abated to the greatest extent possible;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Whenever care in an institution or residential facility is required, it shall be in the least restrictive setting; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Individuals placed in institutions shall be transferred to community or home environments whenever possible, consistent with professional diagnoses and recommendations.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Mistreatment, neglect or abuse in any form of any individual shall be prohibited. The routine use of all forms of restraint shall be eliminated. Physical or chemical restraint shall be employed only when absolutely necessary to prevent an individual from seriously injuring himself or herself, or others. Restraint shall not be employed as a punishment, for the convenience of staff or as a substitute for programs. In any event, restraints may only be applied if alternative techniques have been attempted and failed (such failure to be documented in the individual’s record) and only if such restraints impose the least possible restriction consistent with their purposes. Each facility shall have a written policy defining:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The use of restraints;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The professionals who may authorize such use; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The mechanism for monitoring and controlling such use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Only professionals designated by the Director may order the use of restraints. Such orders shall be in writing and shall not be in force for over 12 hours. An individual placed in restraint shall be checked at least every 30 minutes by staff trained in the use of restraints and a written record of such checks shall be kept.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Mechanical restraints shall be designed for minimum discomfort and used so as not to cause physical injury to the individual.  Opportunity for motion and exercise shall be provided for a period of not less than 10 minutes during each 2 hours in which restraint is employed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Seclusion, defined as a placement of an individual alone in a locked room, shall not be employed. Legitimate “time-out” procedures may be utilized under close and direct professional supervision as a technique in behavior-shaping programs.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Alleged instances of mistreatment, neglect or abuse of any individual shall be reported immediately to the Director and the Director shall inform the individual’s counsel, parent or guardian who petitioned for the commitment, and the individual’s advocate for a person with an intellectual disability of any such instances. There shall be a written report that the allegation has been thoroughly and promptly investigated (with the findings stated therein). Employees of facilities who report such instances of mistreatment, neglect, or abuse shall not be subjected to adverse action by the facility because of the report.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> An individual’s counsel, parent or guardian who petitioned for commitment and an individual’s intellectual disability advocate shall be notified in writing whenever restraints are used and whenever an instance of mistreatment, neglect or abuse occurs.</p>
