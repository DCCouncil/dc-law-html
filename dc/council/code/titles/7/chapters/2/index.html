He or she shall obtain the personal data from the next of kin or the best qualified person or source available and obtain the medical certificate required under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A certificate of death for each death which occurs in the District shall be filed as directed by the Registrar within 5 days after death and before final disposition. The certificate shall be registered if it has been completed and filed according to this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If the place of death is unknown but the dead body is found in the District, the certificate of death shall be completed and filed in the District.

When a death occurs on a moving conveyance while in international waters or air space, or in a foreign country or its air space and the body is first removed from the conveyance in the District, the death shall be registered in the District, but the certificate shall show the actual place of death insofar as can be determined.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Within 48 hours after death, the physician in charge of a patient’s care for the condition which resulted in death shall complete, sign, and return the medical certification portion of the death certificate to the funeral director, except when inquiry is required by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In the absence of such physician or with his or her authorization, the certificate may be completed and signed by his or her associate physician, the chief medical officer of the institution in which death occurred, or the physician who performed an autopsy upon the decedent, if that individual has access to the medical history of the case, views the deceased at or after death, and death is due to natural causes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> When an inquiry is conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the Medical Examiner shall determine the cause of death, and complete, sign, and return the medical certification portion of the death certificate to the funeral director within 48 hours after taking charge of the case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> If the cause of death cannot be determined within 48 hours after death, the medical certification shall be completed as provided by regulation. The physician completing the medical certification or Medical Examiner shall give the funeral director or person acting as the funeral director, notice of the reason of the delay. Final disposition of the body shall not be made until authorized by the physician completing the medical certification or the Medical Examiner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> When a death is presumed to have occurred within the District, but the body cannot be located, a death certificate shall be prepared by the Registrar upon receipt of an order of the Court pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/14-701.html">14-701</a>. The Court order shall include a finding of facts necessary for completion of the death certificate.
