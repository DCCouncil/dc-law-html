                <p>Section 7177 of the Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Support Emergency Amendment Act of 2019 (D.C. Act 23-91) amended <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/22-312.html#§5">§ 5 of D.C. Law 22-312</a> removing the applicability restriction impacting this section. Therefore the amendment of this section by <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/22-312.html">D.C. Law 22-312</a> has been given effect.</p>
                <p>Applicability of <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/22-312.html">D.C. Law 22-312</a>: <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/22-312.html#§5">§ 5 of D.C.
