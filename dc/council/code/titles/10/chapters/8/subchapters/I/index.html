                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Mayor shall submit separate resolutions for the determination that the real property is no longer required for public purposes pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this section and for the approval of its disposition pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the Mayor believes that real property is no longer required for public purposes, the Mayor shall submit to the Council a proposed resolution which includes a finding that the real property is no longer required for public purposes. In the proposed resolution submitted to the Council, the Mayor shall also provide a description of the real property and a detailed explanation as to why the real property is no longer required for public purposes.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The proposed resolution shall be accompanied by an analysis setting forth:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Whether the real property has any necessary use by the District;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Why the determination that the real property is no longer required for public purposes is in the best interests of the District; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> A summary of public comments received at the public hearing required under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The proposed resolution shall be submitted to the Council for a 90-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed resolution within the 90-day period, the proposed resolution shall be deemed disapproved.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Before submitting a proposed resolution pursuant to this subsection, the Mayor shall hold at least one public hearing on the finding that the real property is no longer required for public purposes. The hearing shall be held at an accessible evening or weekend time and in an accessible location in the vicinity of the real property. The Mayor shall provide at least 30 days notice to Advisory Neighborhood Commissions of the public hearing and shall publicize the hearing by placing a notice in the District of Columbia Register at least 15 days before the hearing.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The Mayor shall be deemed to have met the requirements of paragraphs (2)(C) and (4) of this subsection if, prior to April 19, 2010, the Mayor submitted the proposed resolution pursuant to this subsection to the Council and, prior to March 10, 2010, the Mayor engaged in community outreach efforts regarding the real property’s proposed redevelopment; provided, that the community outreach:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Occurred in an accessible location, or accessible locations, in the vicinity of the real property; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Involved a discussion of the proposed redevelopment plan for real property.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-2)</span> If the Council determines that the real property is no longer required for public purposes pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this section, the Mayor shall attempt to dispose of the real property for a use with a direct public benefit as described in a specific government plan adopted by the Mayor or Council, including the Community Development Plan, the Comprehensive Plan, the Strategic Neighborhood Area Plan, or the Comprehensive Housing Strategy Plan.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-3)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If a proposed disposition of real property will result in the development of multifamily residential property consisting of 10 or more units (“multifamily units”), the following affordable housing requirements shall apply:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If the multifamily units are located in the following areas, at least 30% of the units shall be dedicated as affordable housing:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Within ½ mile of a Metrorail station that is in operation or for which a construction contract has been awarded on or before the date of the disposition;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Within ¼ mile of a streetcar line that is in operation or for which a construction contract has been awarded on or before the date of the disposition; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> Within ¼ mile of a Priority Corridor Network Metrobus Route, as designated by the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority, located entirely or partially within the District of Columbia;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> If the multifamily units are located outside of the areas described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, at least 20% of the units shall be dedicated as affordable housing;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The units dedicated as affordable housing pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall remain affordable housing units for the life of the building; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The purchase price for the second and subsequent sales of the units dedicated as affordable housing described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall be determined by a formula established by the Mayor.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The units dedicated as affordable housing pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall be made available according to the following affordability levels:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> In the case of rental units, 25% of the units shall be housing for which a very low-income household will pay no more than 30% of its income toward housing costs, and 75% of such units shall be housing for which a low-income household will pay no more than 30% of its income toward housing costs; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> In the case of ownership units, 50% of the units shall be housing for which a low-income household will pay no more than 30% of its income toward housing costs, and 50% of the units shall be housing for which a moderate-income household will pay no more than 30% of its income toward housing costs.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Mayor shall take into account the affordable housing requirements of this subsection when establishing the terms and conditions under which real property is to be disposed. The Mayor may transfer real property at less than its appraised value or provide additional subsidies to a developer, as necessary, to ensure that the affordable housing requirements imposed by this subsection are met.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The Mayor may waive the affordable housing requirements of this subsection; provided, that the Mayor certifies that:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The appraised value of the property to be disposed is insufficient to support the affordable housing requirements, taking into account all other available sources of public funding for affordable housing, whether provided by the District of Columbia or the federal government;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The terms and conditions under which the real property is to be disposed satisfy the housing requirements to the maximum extent possible; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The Chief Financial Officer has provided to the Mayor and the Council a financial analysis, which shall consist of:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> A review and analysis of the financial condition of disposed land; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> An advisory opinion stating whether or not it is likely that the developer could be reasonably expected to meet the affordable housing requirements outlined in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Paragraph (4) of this subsection shall not apply to the disposition of the building and property owned by the District located at 425 2nd Street, N.W., unless the District commits to using all of the proceeds from the disposition of the property for the construction of a new homeless shelter and affordable housing to serve homeless populations.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The Mayor may reduce the affordable housing requirements of this section if the proposed disposition of real property finances the development of a significant public facility. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “public facility” means a building, structure, or system that is an asset of the District government eligible for capital spending and subject to depreciation. A public facility may include a fire station, public library, public school, stadium, or homeless shelter. Notwithstanding the priority to finance a significant public facility, the Mayor shall nevertheless endeavor to provide affordable housing, consistent with this section, to the extent economically feasible.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Mayor, to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, shall transmit to the Council a proposed resolution that contains the following:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Repealed;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The name and business address of the developer, and, if the developer is a joint venture or partnership, the name and business address of each person that constitutes the partnership;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> A description of the real property to be disposed of;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A description of the intended use for the property (“Project”);</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> If applicable, a finding that the Developer will achieve the affordable housing requirements established by subsection (a-3) of this section or, if those requirements will not be achieved, a written certification by the Chief Financial Officer pursuant to subsection (a-3)(4) of this section;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> A finding that the Developer will enter into an agreement that shall require the Developer to, at a minimum, contract with Certified Business Enterprises for at least 35% of the contract dollar volume of the project, and shall require at least 20% equity and 20% development participation of Certified Business Enterprises;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> A finding that the Developer will enter into a First Source Agreement with the District that shall govern certain obligations of Developer pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-219.03.html">2-219.03</a> and Mayor’s Order 83-265 (November 9, 1983) regarding job creation and employment generated as a result of the construction on the Property;</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> A combination sale/leaseback for specifically designated purposes;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> An exchange of interests in real property; or</p>
