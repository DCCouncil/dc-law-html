The Director shall provide an opportunity for review of the corrective action taken without prejudice to the Director’s authority to take and complete remedial action if it is determined to be necessary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If the owner takes corrective action to secure or repair the unsafe private structure as required by this chapter, the Director shall provide the owner with notice, as provided for in this chapter if additional remedial repairs are determined to be necessary to restore the private structure and the public space to a safe condition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Notice required by [this] chapter shall be deemed to have been served if the person or an authorized agent is notified by personal service or by registered mail sent to the person’s last known address and by the conspicuous posting of the notice on the unsafe private structure. If the person or person’s address is unknown or the person fails to accept service either personally or by registered mail, then notice is deemed served upon the person by the posting of a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the person’s property that abuts the unsafe private structure.</p>
