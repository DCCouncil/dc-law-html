                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> There is established within the General Fund of the District of Columbia, a segregated, nonlapsing special revenue fund to be denominated as the Ballpark Revenue Fund. Except as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-1203.07.html">10-1203.07</a>, the Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia shall pay into the Ballpark Revenue Fund all receipts from those fees and taxes specifically identified by any provision of District of Columbia law to be paid into the fund and any rent paid pursuant to a lease of the ballpark. The Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia shall create a sub-account within the Ballpark Revenue Fund for each type of fee and tax that is to be paid into the fund and shall allocate the receipts from each type of fee and tax to the appropriate sub-account.

If bonds or other evidence of indebtedness are issued, the payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the documents entered into by the District or any District agency or instrumentality in connection with the issuance of the bonds or other evidence of indebtedness. Notwithstanding Article 9 of Subtitle I of Title 28, or any other provision to the contrary, any security interest created pursuant to this subsection shall be valid, binding, and perfected from the time that the security interest is created, with or without the physical delivery of any funds or any other property, with or without further action, and whether or not any statement, document, or instrument relating to the security interest is recorded or filed. The lien created by the security interest shall be valid, binding, and perfected with respect to any person, as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2001.html">47-2001</a>(i), having claims against the District, whether or not such person has notice of the lien.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> To directly pay or finance all or any of the costs of the demolition of buildings located on the future site of the ballpark and the cost of environmental remediation of the land that is the future site of the ballpark;</p>
