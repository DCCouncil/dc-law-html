Wilson Building (“Wilson Building”).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Wilson Building is the traditional seat of local government located on Pennsylvania Avenue, the “Main Street” of the Nation’s Capital, and a source of pride and hope for our District residents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Wilson Building is in need of renovation and restoration and contains environmental conditions which should be eliminated to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to ensure compliance with all federal and local building regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Because of the current fiscal state of the District government, funds are not available to make expenditures estimated at $47.1 million to $60 million to renovate and restore the Wilson Building.</p>
