                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/16-33.html">D.C. Law 16-33</a> substituted “June 30, 2006” for “December 31, 1998”; and deleted “There shall be a moratorium on disposition decisions until the facilities plan has been approved by the Council.”</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/16-123.html">D.C. Law 16-123</a>, designated the existing text as subsec. (a); in subsec. (a), substituted “multiyear Facilities Master Plan, which shall include” for “Long Range Master Facilities Plan which shall include annual updates to the facilities plan, as well as”; and added subsecs. (b), (c), and (d).</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/17-9.html">D.C. Law 17-9</a> rewrote subsecs. (a), (b)(1), (c), and (d).</p>

Law 20-114</a> repealed (b)(1)(A); added “projected 5-year facility needs for each local education agency” in (b)(2)(B); made minor stylistic changes in (b)(2)(J) and (b)(2)(K); and added (b)(2)(L) and (b)(2A); added “and the annual supplement” in the introductory language of (b)(3); rewrote (b)(3)(A); in (b)(3)(B)(i), substituted “Collect and transmit” for “Transmit” and added “5-year enrollment growth plans”; made minor stylistic changes in (b)(3)(C) and (b)(3)(D); and added (b)(3)(E) and (e).</p>

                <h4>Applicability</h4>
                <p> Section 7025 of D.C. Law 22-_____ repealed section 3 of D.C. Law 21-219, thus removing the applicability limitation. Therefore the change made to this section by that amendment has been implemented.</p>
