                <p>“(10) A strategy to support and incentivize CTE programs to provide night or weekend CTE course offerings to adult District residents; and</p>

                <p>“(f)(1) The city-wide strategic plan shall be submitted to the Council for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the plan, in whole or in part, by resolution within this 45-day review period, the plan shall be deemed approved.</p>
                <p>“(2) If the plan is disapproved by the Council, the Council’s Committee of the Whole shall transmit a report to the CTE Task Force citing the Council’s concerns within 30 days of the disapproval and the CTE Task Force shall have 30 days from the date it received the report to review the report and re-submit a new plan to the Mayor and the Council for approval in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.”</p>
