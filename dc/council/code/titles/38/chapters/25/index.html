                <p>“(3) Goals —target levels of performance expressed in tangible, measurable terms, against which actual achievement of objectives can be compared; a goal may be expressed as a population target, or as a quantitative standard, value, or rate.</p>
                <p>“(b) The performance plan shall describe the strategy for how the mission (including its needs assessment goals and service delivery goals and objectives) will be accomplished.

There shall be one or more measures of performance, that address both quantity and quality, for each goal. The performance plan shall state measurable or objective performance goals and objectives for all significant activities of the agency or program.
