                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> “Intelligence Section” means the Intelligence Section of the Special Investigations Division of MPD, or its successor section or unit.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> “Legitimate law enforcement objective” means the detection, investigation, deterrence, or prevention of crime, or the apprehension and prosecution of a suspected criminal; provided, that a person shall not be considered to be pursuing a legitimate law enforcement objective if the person is acting based upon the race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, lawful political affiliation or activity, or lawful news-gathering activity of an individual or group.</p>
