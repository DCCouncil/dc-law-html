If an entity files a corrected entity filing within 60 days of the date the document was initially rejected for filing, it shall not be required to pay a filing fee.

No. 87-569; 76 Stat. 265), which did not elect to avail itself of the provisions of those acts:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Until January 1, 2014, the corporation shall be governed by the statute under which it was formed as if that statute had not been repealed by this act.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Before January 1, 2014, the corporation may elect to avail itself of the provisions of this title by adopting a resolution making this election, and by delivering to the Mayor for filing a copy of the resolution and a copy of the corporation’s articles of incorporation. Upon filing by the Mayor of the resolution and articles, the corporation shall be deemed to exist under this title. The corporation shall file a biennial report, as required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-102.11.html">29-102.11</a>, by the next April 1 following the date of delivery of the resolution and articles to the Mayor for filing.</p>

Upon filing by the Mayor of the resolution and articles, the corporation shall be deemed to exist under this title. In the event such election is made, to the extent the provisions of this title, including chapter 4 (the Nonprofit Corporations Act of 2010), are inconsistent with such nonprofit corporation’s congressional charter or its bylaws, the provisions of such nonprofit corporation’s congressional charter and bylaws shall prevail.</p>
