                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, the Superior Court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, a charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited liability company to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order in effect under subsection (a) of this section, the Superior Court may:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the Superior Court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale shall obtain the transferable interest, shall not thereby become a member, and shall be subject to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-805.02.html">29-805.02</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c) of this section, a limited liability company or one or more members whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> If a court orders foreclosure of a charging order lien against the sole member of a limited liability company:</p>

This subsection shall not prevent the court from enforcing a person’s right to information under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-804.10.html">29-804.10</a> or, for good cause shown, granting extraordinary relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.</p>

If the court finds that the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and that the committee acted in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered under subsection (a) of this section and allow the action to proceed under the direction of the plaintiff.</p>
