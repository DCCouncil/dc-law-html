If the company appoints a special litigation committee, on motion by the committee made in the name of the company, except for good cause shown, the Superior Court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation. This subsection shall not prevent the court from enforcing a person’s right to information under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-804.10.html">29-804.10</a> or, for good cause shown, granting extraordinary relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.</p>

If the court finds that the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and that the committee acted in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered under subsection (a) of this section and allow the action to proceed under the direction of the plaintiff.</p>
