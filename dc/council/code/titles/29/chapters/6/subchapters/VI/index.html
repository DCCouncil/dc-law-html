                <p>A partner shall be dissociated from a partnership when:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The partnership has notice of the partner’s express will to withdraw as a partner or on a later date specified by the partner;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> An event agreed to in the partnership agreement as causing the partner’s dissociation occurs;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The partner is expelled pursuant to the partnership agreement;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The partner is expelled by the unanimous vote of the other partners if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> It is unlawful to carry on the partnership business with that partner;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> There has been a transfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a transfer for security purposes, or a court order charging the partner’s interest, which has not been foreclosed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Within 90 days after the partnership notifies a corporate partner that it will be expelled because it has filed a certificate of dissolution or the equivalent, its charter has been revoked, or its right to conduct business has been suspended by the jurisdiction of its incorporation, there is no revocation of the certificate of dissolution or no reinstatement of its charter or its right to conduct business; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> A partnership that is a partner has been dissolved and its business is being wound up;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> On application by the partnership or another partner, the partner is expelled by judicial determination because the partner:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the partnership business;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the partnership agreement or of a duty owed to the partnership or the other partners under § 29-604.04; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business which makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with the partner;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Became a debtor in bankruptcy;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Executed an assignment for the benefit of creditors;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Sought, consented to, or acquiesced in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of that partner or of all or substantially all of that partner’s property; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Failed, within 90 days after the appointment, to have vacated or stayed the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the partner or of all or substantially all of the partner’s property obtained without the partner’s consent or acquiescence, or failed within 90 days after the expiration of a stay to have the appointment vacated;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> In the case of a partner who is an individual:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The partner dies;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A guardian or general conservator is appointed for the partner; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> There is a judicial determination that the partner has otherwise become incapable of performing the partner’s duties under the partnership agreement;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> In the case of a partner that is a trust or is acting as a partner by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, the trust’s entire transferable interest in the partnership is distributed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> In the case of a partner that is an estate or is acting as a partner by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, the estate’s entire transferable interest in the partnership is distributed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> A partner that is not an individual, partnership, corporation, trust, or estate dissolves and completes winding up; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(11)</span> The partnership participates in a merger, interest exchange, conversion, or domestication under Chapter 2 of this title or Subchapter [subchapter] IX of this chapter and, as a result, the person ceases to be a partner.</p>
