                <p>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-210 deleted “subsection (b) of this section or” following “provided in” in (a); substituted “a person designated under subsection (e)(8) or (9) of this section, the beneficial owners, and the statutory trust” for “the beneficial owners, the statutory trust, and other persons” in (a)(2); substituted “Subject to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-1204.03.html">29-1204.03</a>, provide” for “Provide” in (e)(5) and (e)(6); substituted “interest exchange, or domestication” for “or reorganization” in (e)(6)(B); and substituted “activities” for “business” in (e)(8).</p>
                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>

                <p>Section 2(l)(2)(B)(ii)(II)(bb) of D.C. Law 19-210 purported to amend subsection (e)(6)(A) of this section, but by its context clearly intended to amend (e)(6)(B). The amendment has been implemented in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-1201.03.html">29-1201.03</a>(e)(6)(B).</p>
                <p>Application of Law 19-210: Section 7 of D.C. Law 19-210 provided that the act shall apply as of January 1, 2012.</p>
