Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale shall obtain only the financial rights that are subject to the charging order, shall not thereby become a member, and shall be subject to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-1006.03.html">29-1006.03</a>.</p>
