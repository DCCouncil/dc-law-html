The board of directors shall also transmit to the members a recommendation that the members approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances, it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors must transmit to the members the basis for that determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of merger or membership exchange to the members on any basis.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or the board of directors acting pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of the plan of merger or membership exchange by the members shall require the approval of the members at a meeting at which a quorum exists, and, if any class of memberships is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or membership exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Separate voting by voting groups shall be required:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> On a plan of merger or membership exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of merger or membership exchange.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> If as a result of a merger or membership exchange one or more members of a domestic nonprofit corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of merger or membership exchange shall require the signature, by each such member, of a separate record consenting to become subject to such owner liability.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> If a domestic nonprofit corporation that is a party to a merger does not have any members entitled to vote thereon, a plan of merger shall be deemed adopted by the corporation when it has been adopted by the board of directors pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> In addition to the adoption and approval of the plan of merger by the board of directors and members as required by this section, the plan of merger shall also be approved in the form of a record by any person or group of persons whose approval is required under § <cite path="§29-408.40">29-408.40</cite> to amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws.</p>
