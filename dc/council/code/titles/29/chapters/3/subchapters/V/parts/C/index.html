When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and agreement to the corporation’s principal office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A voting trust shall be effective on the date the 1st shares subject to the trust are registered in the trustee’s name.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> All or some of the parties to a voting trust may extend it for additional terms of not more than 10 years each by signing written consent to the extension. An extension shall be valid for 10 years after the date the 1st shareholder signs the extension agreement. The voting trustee shall deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of beneficial owners to the corporation’s principal office. An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it.</p>
