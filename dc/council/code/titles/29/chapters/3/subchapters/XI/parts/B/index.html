In addition, if applicable, the shareholder shall certify on the form whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-311.12.html">29-311.12</a>(b)(1).
