                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Notice under this chapter must be in writing unless oral notice is reasonable under the circumstances. Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, words in a notice or other communication under this chapter must be in English.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A notice or other communication may be given or sent by any method of delivery, except that electronic transmissions must be sent in accordance with this section. If these methods of communication are impracticable, a notice or other communication may be communicated by a newspaper of general circulation in the area where published, or by radio, television, or other form of public broadcast communication.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Notice or other communication to a domestic or a registered foreign corporation may be delivered to its registered agent at its registered office or to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a foreign corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in its application for a certificate of registration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Notice or other communications may be delivered by electronic transmission if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The recipient consents or if authorized by subsection (k) of this section;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The electronic transmission contains or is accompanied by information from which the recipient can determine the date of the transmission; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The transmission was authorized by the sender.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Consent under subsection (d) of this section may be revoked by giving written or electronic notice to the original recipient of the consent. Any such consent is deemed revoked if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Two consecutive electronic transmissions are undeliverable; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The secretary, assistant secretary, transfer agent, or other person responsible for the provision of notice or other communications knows of the delivery failure. Any inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Unless otherwise agreed between sender and recipient, an electronic transmission is considered received when:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> It enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purposes of receiving electronic transmissions or information of the type sent, and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic transmission; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> It is in a form capable of being processed by that system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subsection (f )(1) of this section establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> An electronic transmission is considered received under this section even if no individual is aware of its receipt.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If mailed postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a shareholder upon deposit in the United States mail;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a recipient other than a shareholder, the earliest of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, the date the return receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> 5 days after it is deposited in the United States mail;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If an electronic transmission, when it is received as provided in subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> If oral, when communicated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> If this title prescribes requirements for notices or other communications in particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe requirements for notices or other communications, not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of this title, those requirements govern. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize or require delivery of notices of meetings of directors by electronic transmission.</p>
