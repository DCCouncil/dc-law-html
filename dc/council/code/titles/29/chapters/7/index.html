                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, the Superior Court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited partnership to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that otherwise would be paid to the judgment debtor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order in effect under subsection (a) of this section, the Superior Court may:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the Superior Court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a partner, and is subject to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-707.02.html">29-707.02</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c) of this section, the partner or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) of this section may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the Superior Court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c) of this section, a limited partnership or one or more partners whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> This chapter does not deprive any partner or transferee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the transferable interest of the partner or transferee.</p>

If the court finds that the members of the committee met their burden of proof, were disinterested and independent, and that the committee acted in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered under subsection (a) of this section and allow the action to proceed under the direction of the plaintiff.</p>
