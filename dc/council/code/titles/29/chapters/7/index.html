                        <span>On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, the Superior Court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment.

The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a partner, and is subject to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-707.02.html">29-707.02</a>.</span>
