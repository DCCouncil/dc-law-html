                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Credible because the standard is developed by a person that both:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Has access to necessary expertise to assess overall corporate social and environmental performance; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(III)</span> An accounting of the sources of financial support for the organization, with sufficient detail to disclose any relationships that could reasonably be considered to present a potential conflict of interest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> For purposes of the definitions of the terms “independent” and “subsidiary” in subsection (a) of this section, a percentage of ownership in an entity shall be calculated as if all outstanding rights to acquire equity interests in the entity have been exercised.</p>
