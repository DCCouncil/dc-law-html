                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> AccessRx enables the District to take steps to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified District residents, thereby increasing the overall health of District residents, promoting healthy communities, and protecting the public health and welfare.</p>
