                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/13-160.html">D.C. Law 13-160</a> rewrote subsec. (b) which formerly provided: “(b) Property subject to forfeiture under this chapter may be seized by law enforcement officials, as designated by the Mayor, or designated civilian employees of the Metropolitan Police Department, upon process issued by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia having jurisdiction over the property, or without process if authorized by other law.”</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-21.html">D.C. Law 19-21</a> rewrote subsec. (d)(3)(B), which formerly read:</p>
                <p>“(B) Any person claiming the property may, at any time within 30 days from the date of receipt of notice of seizure, file with the Mayor a claim stating his or her interest in the property. Upon the filing of a claim, the claimant shall give a bond to the District government in the penal sum of $2,500 or 10% of the fair market value of the claimed property (as appraised by the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department), whichever is lower, but not less than $250, with sureties to be approved by the Mayor. In case of forfeiture of the claimed property, the costs and expenses of the forfeiture proceedings shall be deducted from the bonds. Any costs that exceed the amount of the bond shall be paid by the claimant. In determining the fair market value of the property seized, the Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department shall consider any verifiable and reasonable evidence of value that the claimant may present. The balance of the proceeds shall be transferred to the Drug Interdiction and Demand Reduction Fund (’Fund’) created by subchapter VII of this chapter. The Fund shall remain available until expended regardless of the expiration of the fiscal year in which the proceeds were collected. The Fund shall be distributed in the following descending order of priority:</p>
                <p>“ (i) To fund law enforcement activities of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, except that, beginning October 1, 1990, not more than 49% of the total amount deposited to the Fund in the immediately preceding quarter-year period shall be used for this purpose in the next succeeding quarter-year period; and</p>
                <p>“(ii) To provide grants to fund community-based drug education, prevention, and demand reduction programs;”</p>
                <p>The 2012 amendment by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-171.html">D.C. Law 19-171</a> validated a previously made technical correction.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Issuance and execution of administrative inspection warrants shall be as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> A judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, upon proper oath or affirmation showing probable cause, may issue warrants for the purpose of conducting administrative inspections authorized by this chapter or rules hereunder, and seizures of property appropriate to the inspections. For purposes of the issuance of administrative inspection warrants, probable cause exists upon showing a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this chapter or rules hereunder, sufficient to justify administrative inspection of the area, premises, building, or conveyance in the circumstances specified in the application for the warrant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> A warrant shall issue only upon an affidavit of a designated officer or employee having knowledge of the facts alleged, sworn to before the judge and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. If the judge is satisfied that grounds for the issuance of the warrant exist or that there is probable cause to believe they exist, a warrant shall be issued identifying the area, premises, building, or conveyance to be inspected, the purpose of the inspection, and, if appropriate, the type of property to be inspected, if any. The warrant shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)">(A)</span> State the grounds for its issuance and the name of each person whose affidavit has been taken in support thereof;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Be directed to a person authorized and designated by the Mayor to execute it;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Command the person to whom it is directed to inspect the area, premises, building, or conveyance identified for the purpose specified and, if appropriate, direct the seizure of the property specified;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(D)">(D)</span> Identify the item or types of property to be seized, if any; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(E)">(E)</span> Direct that it be served during normal business hours and designate the judge to whom it shall be returned.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> A warrant issued pursuant to this section must be executed and returned within 10 days of its date unless, upon a showing of a need for additional time, the Court orders otherwise. If property is seized pursuant to a warrant, a copy shall be given to the person from whom or from whose premises the property is taken, together with a receipt for the property taken. The return of the warrant shall be made promptly, accompanied by a written inventory of any property taken. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the person executing the warrant and of the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, if present, or in the presence of at least one person other than the person executing the warrant. A copy of the inventory shall be delivered to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken and to the applicant for the warrant.</p>

The attendance of witnesses and the production of records may be required from any place in the District of Columbia.

The court may issue an order requiring the subpoenaed person to appear before the Mayor to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.</p>
