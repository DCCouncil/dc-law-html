            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>The Council of the District of Columbia makes the following findings and supports the following purposes:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Many shipments of hazardous materials are made in the District of Columbia (“District”);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> The District is 1 of the few states that has not adopted the federal regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials and motor carrier safety;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> According to statistics compiled by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, there have been 30 incidents involving the unintentional release of hazardous materials in transport in the District since 1985, none of which have been required by law to be reported to the District government;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> There have been a growing number of incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials on highways surrounding the District in recent months;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> According to the United States Department of Transportation, there is an insufficient number of federal inspectors available to inspect vehicles transporting hazardous materials, causing many vehicles to go uninspected unless the states have regulations enabling them to carry out inspections;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> The District does not have a procedure for inspecting the safety of commercial motor vehicles that transport hazardous materials in the city, nor for monitoring the condition of the operators of those vehicles;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(7)">(7)</span> Until the District adopts a system consistent with the federal motor carrier safety regulations that govern commercial motor vehicles, including those transporting hazardous materials, the District is ineligible to receive at least $225,000 per year in federal grant assistance for implementing the regulations;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(8)">(8)</span> Other costs to the District associated with enforcing this chapter should be the responsibility of those who transport hazardous materials in the District;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(9)">(9)</span> The Hazardous Materials Study Commission will no longer be necessary since the Commission’s mandate will be executed through the implementation of this chapter; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(10)">(10)</span> Residents of and visitors to the District should be protected from the serious risks associated with improper transportation of hazardous materials, overworked operators, and unsuitable maintenance of commercial motor vehicles, including vehicles transporting hazardous materials.</p>

                <p>The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> A terrorist attack on a large-quantity hazardous material shipment near the United States Capitol (“Capitol”) would be expected to cause tens of thousands of deaths and a catastrophic economic impact of $5 billion or more.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> The threat of terrorism facing District of Columbia residents and workers in the vicinity of the Capitol requires an urgent response that recognizes and addresses the unique status of this area in American politics and history, and the risk of terrorism that results from this status.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> While the federal government has occupied the field of en route security and routing in the aviation context, it has not addressed the subject of rail car routing for security purposes. Moreover, the federal government has not acted to address the terrorist threat resulting from the transportation of ultra-hazardous materials within 2 miles of the Capitol, the White House, and the United States Supreme Court, unique terrorist targets.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> Shippers of ultra-hazardous materials do not need to route large quantities of ultra-hazardous chemicals near the Capitol in order to ship these chemicals to their destinations, and alternative routes would substantially decrease the aggregate risk posed by terrorist attacks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> Requiring permits for ultra-hazardous shipments from a Capitol Exclusion Zone that encompasses all points within 2.2 miles of the Capitol would impose no significant burden on interstate commerce.</p>
