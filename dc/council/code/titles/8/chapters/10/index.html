                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The task force shall advise the Department of Public Works with respect to the statutory requirements for the use of recycled newsprint.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The task force shall convene during the 1st quarter of 1994 and will issue its report by the 3rd quarter of 1994.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> 2 representatives of environmental groups with expertise in recycling;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> 1 representative of the recycled newsprint industry; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(5)">(5)</span> 1 representative of an industry, other than newsprint, that uses old newspapers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The task force shall perform the following responsibilities:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Review the reports filed under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/8-1020.html">8-1020</a>;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> Consider the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Extent of recovery of old newspapers from the District’s waste stream;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Cost to the District to recover and market old newspapers;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Availability and utilization in the District of newsprint containing recycled material; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(D)">(D)</span> Nature and extent of other recycling uses for old newspapers; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> In accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, the task force may comment on whether a recycled newsprint law is necessary, and if so, whether the recycled content percentage requirement for newsprint should remain the same or be adjusted. The task force may also consider whether the recycled content requirement encourages manufacturers of virgin newsprint to convert to recycling and whether the requirement adversely affects recycling uses for old newspapers other than the production of newsprint.</p>
