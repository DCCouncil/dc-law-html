                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> National categorical pretreatment standards set forth at 40 C.F.R. § 403.6 and prohibited discharge standards set forth at 40 C.F.R. §§ 403.5(a) and (b) shall not be waived, unless such waiver is granted by mechanisms established under the Federal pretreatment regulations (40 C.F.R. § 403 et seq.).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In no case shall a special agreement or waiver of local limits allow for an industrial user to discharge any pollutant which, alone or in combination with other regulated industrial user discharges, would reasonably be expected to exceed the mass loadings determined by WASA as acceptable to the sewage treatment plant based upon considerations of, among other things, interference, pass through, and sludge contamination. WASA may consider other factors (e.g., effect of the discharge on the POTW, future expansion, etc.), as it considers appropriate. In no event shall special agreement or waiver allow the sum of the loadings allocated to all industrial users for any pollutant to exceed the maximum allowable industrial loading set forth in any local limits analysis submitted by WASA and approved by EPA as part of WASA’s pretreatment program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> WASA may require an industrial user requesting a special agreement or waiver adjusting effluent limitations to submit supporting documentation indicating why the industrial user cannot reasonably expect to meet the effluent limitation contained in its wastewater discharge permit, setting forth an expeditious schedule for achieving compliance with such limitations, and including such other information as WASA may require. In granting any special agreement or waiver WASA may impose time limitations upon any reduced requirements and provide a compliance schedule for achieving compliance. In granting any special agreement or waiver, WASA may impose any other conditions it considers necessary to implement the purposes of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If granting a special agreement or waiver would result in increased costs to WASA, (e.g., treatment, monitoring, sludge disposal costs), WASA may condition the special agreement or waiver upon the agreement of the industrial user to pay those costs, and to provide security adequate in the judgment of WASA to assure payment of those costs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> All special agreements or waivers shall be requested and granted in writing.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Effecting service of any notice, order or other document produced by a person or issued by WASA pursuant to this subsection; provided, however, that WASA shall bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Notice of Infraction was not defective, that the Notice of Infraction was properly served, and that an infraction occurred;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Answering or otherwise responding to any notice, order, or other document issued pursuant to this subsection;</p>

The Court shall make a determination of each appeal on the basis of the record established before the hearing examiner, and may affirm, reverse, or modify the order of the hearing examiner, or may remand the case for further proceedings before the hearing examiner subject to the qualifications set forth in this subsection. The Court shall set aside any hearing examiner order that is unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record. The Court shall also set aside any hearing examiner order that was made without observance of procedure required by law or regulations, except that in such instances, the Court shall apply the rule of harmless error. The Court may not modify a sanction imposed by the hearing examiner if that sanction is within the limits established by law or regulation.</p>
