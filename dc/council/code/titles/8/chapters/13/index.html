                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> To insure safe and effective hazardous waste management;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To establish a program of regulation over the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and fuel containing hazardous waste and the production, marketing, distribution, and burning of fuel produced from or containing hazardous waste; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> To reduce or eliminate at the source, wherever feasible and as expeditiously as possible, the generation of hazardous waste and the release of toxic chemicals in the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Increasing production and consumption rates, continuing technological development, and energy requirements have led to the generation of greater quantities of hazardous waste;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The problems of disposing of hazardous waste are increasing as a result of air and water pollution controls and a shortage of available landfill sites;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> While it is technologically and financially feasible for hazardous waste generators to reduce and eliminate wastes generated, and to dispose of their wastes in a manner which has a less adverse impact on the environment than current practices, such knowledge is not being utilized to the extent possible;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Even though the District of Columbia is not heavily industrialized, there is a significant daily hazardous waste disposal problem;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The public health and safety, and the environment, are threatened where hazardous wastes are not managed in an environmentally sound manner;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> In accordance with section 101(b) of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, approved November 8, 1984 (98 Stat. 3224; 42 U.S.C. § 6902(b)), it is the policy of the District of Columbia that, wherever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste and the release of toxic chemicals is to be reduced or eliminated as expeditiously as possible; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Other states and local jurisdictions that have implemented source reduction technical assistance programs for businesses have shown programs to be cost-effective.</p>
