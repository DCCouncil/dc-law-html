                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> To establish a program of regulation over the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and fuel containing hazardous waste and the production, marketing, distribution, and burning of fuel produced from or containing hazardous waste; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> To reduce or eliminate at the source, wherever feasible and as expeditiously as possible, the generation of hazardous waste and the release of toxic chemicals in the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Increasing production and consumption rates, continuing technological development, and energy requirements have led to the generation of greater quantities of hazardous waste;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The problems of disposing of hazardous waste are increasing as a result of air and water pollution controls and a shortage of available landfill sites;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> The public health and safety, and the environment, are threatened where hazardous wastes are not managed in an environmentally sound manner;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> In accordance with section 101(b) of the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, approved November 8, 1984 (98 Stat. 3224; 42 U.S.C. § 6902(b)), it is the policy of the District of Columbia that, wherever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste and the release of toxic chemicals is to be reduced or eliminated as expeditiously as possible; and</p>
