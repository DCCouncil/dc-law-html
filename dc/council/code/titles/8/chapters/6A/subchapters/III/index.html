                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> General numerical or performance standards, which describe the concentrations of hazardous substances in groundwater, surface water and soils that will allow a property to be used for any purpose;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The procedures that DDOE shall use to establish and approve site or property-specific standard based on the assessments of health and environmental risks at a property. The standards may rely on engineering or institutional controls protective of public health, welfare and the environment. DDOE may designate and publish the particular engineering controls it deems as protective of public health, welfare and the environment in specified circumstances; and may designate the circumstances as containing presumptive remedies, taking into account the type of hazardous substances on the contaminated property and the proposed use of the property.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The cleanup standards established by DDOE based on the District’s environmental policy, law, or regulations in effect prior to June 13, 2001, shall apply to hazardous substances in any other media apart from groundwater; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> For hazardous substances in any media apart from groundwater, for which interim cleaning standards cannot be determined pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the cleanup standards established by the application of risk assessment regulations of the District’s leaking underground storage tank program shall apply.</p>
