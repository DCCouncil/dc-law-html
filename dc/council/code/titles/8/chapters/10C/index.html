                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Within 45 days of its first meeting, the Panel shall provide notice of and hold a public meeting to receive testimony from citizens in respect to the operation of solid waste facilities in the District of Columbia, and shall hold an additional public meeting to present the Panel’s findings and a draft report to the community for comment 20 days prior to submitting to the Council the report required by this chapter.</p>
