                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Owners and operators of solid waste facilities subject to the provisions of this chapter shall submit periodic reports to the Mayor at the times specified by regulation. The reports shall contain all information the Mayor considers reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. Records necessary to comply with this reporting requirement shall be maintained in a central location at each solid waste facility for a period of time prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor may provide by rulemaking that failure to submit periodic reports or maintain records may result in the imposition of a fine of up to $25,000, suspension or revocation of a solid waste facility permit, or both.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The information contained in the periodic reports and the application shall be considered proprietary and held confidential by the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> All new and existing solid waste facilities holding interim and permanent operating permits pursuant to this chapter shall comply with the following operating and reporting requirements and prohibitions:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Within six months from the effective date of the Solid Waste Facility Permit Amendment Act of 1998 each solid waste facility shall develop a traffic flow plan showing the routes used by inbound and outbound vehicles to the facility from the nearest arterial roads and any other arterial roads used by inbound or outbound vehicles.  If the facility is located on an arterial road, the traffic flow plan shall encompass an area of no less than four blocks from the solid waste facility in any direction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> No solid waste facility permit shall be issued until the traffic control plan has been assessed and approved by the Department of Public Works, which may set reasonable criteria for each plan as it deems necessary. Each solid waste facility shall submit traffic flow plans to the Department of Public Works.  Each facility shall provide notice in the District of Columbia Register, of its traffic flow plan to each Advisory Neighborhood Commission (“ANC”) adjacent to the ANC in which the solid waste facility is operating and through which any of the inbound or outbound vehicles pass through for comment, publish the plan in a newspaper of general circulation in the District of Columbia and post the complete plan at the solid waste facility for public review. ANC comments must be submitted no later than 45 days after publication.  A copy of any study, survey, professional opinion, or other materials relied upon by a solid waste facility in developing or submitting a traffic flow plan shall be provided to any requesting ANC.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The traffic flow plan shall be designed to maximize use of truck routes or other arterial traffic routes of 4 or more lanes and to minimize truck traffic on residential streets or through residential areas.   The plan shall include, at a minimum, a map designating the proposed travel routes for all trucks traveling to and from the facility and a plan for enforcement of the traffic flow plan by the facility.  Inbound vehicles shall use arterial roads except when collecting waste.  Outbound vehicles shall only use arterial or heavier roads, except for roads identified and approved in a facility’s traffic flow plan.  The traffic flow plan shall be implemented immediately upon approval by the Department of Public Works.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Tracking by vehicles entering or exiting solid waste facilities on public space is prohibited.

The waste collected from the street sweeping equipment shall be transported to a licensed land field.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Solid waste facilities shall install an entry and exit system, using BACT, as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days from the effective date of the Solid Waste Facility Permit Amendment Act of 1998, to prevent dust and odors from escaping from the facility and to prevent animals and disease vectors from entering or exiting the facility.  Truck doors or bays to the facility shall remain closed except when a vehicle is entering or exiting the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Each solid waste facility shall establish and maintain clean, waste-free paths within the facility pursuant to BACT.  All trucks or other vehicles that use public roads must remain on those waste-free paths while within the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> Each solid waste facility shall maintain a tire cleaning area near the exit to the facility.  The tire cleaning area shall be designed to employ BACT standards.  All waste water used in the facility shall be directed to a treatment area within the facility or to a municipal water treatment plant.  Any waste water directed to a municipal water treatment plant shall conform with all applicable local and federal pre-treatment standards.  The tires of trucks or other facility vehicles that use public roads shall be cleaned in the tire cleaning area before the trucks or other vehicles may exit the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> Each existing solid waste facility shall continuously abate for disease vectors within a 4 block radius of the site, or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Health, Environmental Health Administration and the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs that the facility is not providing vector harborage.  The owner or operator of the solid waste facility shall provide reasonable notice to the community and seek permission to conduct abatement activities on all private properties within the 4 block radius before commencing abatement.  Bait and traps shall not be placed on private property without the consent of the owner or occupant of the property.  Bait and traps shall not be placed in open areas that are accessible to children or pets.

            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> There is established the Solid Waste Transfer Facility Site Selection Advisory Panel (“Panel”) with the purpose of preparing comprehensive recommendations to the Council that identify tracts of land suitable for solid waste transfer operations within appropriately zoned sections of the District that safeguard the health, safety and welfare of residents and businesses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Panel shall submit its recommendations in a report, which shall include a map that identifies potential sites for the location of solid waste facilities, within 6 months of the Panel’s first meeting.  The Panel shall rate each site according to its suitability for the purpose of solid waste transfer and shall consider the proximity of other potential sites in rating each site.  The potential sites the Panel identifies shall comply with all siting requirements of this chapter, shall not be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan and shall not increase or compound existing detrimental environmental impacts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> In addition to identifying potential sites and rating these sites, the Panel shall study and report on:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The District’s reasonable carrying capacity as a regional solid waste facility site based on best practices in solid waste management;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> An evaluation of the impact of existing solid waste facilities on local residents;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> A study of the solid waste needs of the District;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The total revenue the District has received yearly from each solid waste facility operating in the District since the Certificate of Occupancy was issued for the facility, showing the kinds of taxes and fees that have been paid; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The available control technologies capable of complying with the BACT standard for the solid waste.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Panel is authorized to seek the advice of experts with knowledge of the following areas of concern:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Construction techniques for solid waste handling facilities, including knowledge of air modeling and emissions control;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Traffic flow and infrastructure impact and degradation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Interstate commerce and the economics of solid waste management.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The Panel shall consult with District agencies with solid waste management expertise, including, but not limited to, the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the Department of Public Works and the Department of Health.  The Panel shall also consult with the Washington Area Council of Governments and its staff to inform the Panel of regional considerations in solid waste management.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The Panel shall consult with the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which is a federal advisory committee established to provide independent judgment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on environmental issues and which is studying or will study the health and environmental impacts of municipal waste transfer operations on minority and disadvantaged communities, including the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> Within 45 days of its first meeting, the Panel shall provide notice of and hold a public meeting to receive testimony from citizens in respect to the operation of solid waste facilities in the District of Columbia, and shall hold an additional public meeting to present the Panel’s findings and a draft report to the community for comment 20 days prior to submitting to the Council the report required by this chapter.</p>
