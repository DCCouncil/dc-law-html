                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An adequate, reliable, and continuous supply of energy is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the District of Columbia and to sustain the growth of the District’s economy;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The District of Columbia is seriously threatened and adversely affected by the increasing shortages and the escalating prices of nonrenewable energy resources;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Growth in the consumption of energy resources is due in part to wasteful and inefficient uses of energy, and the continuation of this trend will adversely affect the social, economic, and environmental development of the District of Columbia;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> It is the responsibility of the District of Columbia government to encourage and foster a reliable and adequate supply of energy resources for the District at a level consistent with the protection of public health and safety, the promotion of the general welfare and economic well-being, and the promotion of environmental quality;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The District of Columbia must provide for the development of a unified energy policy:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> To minimize duplication and overlapping responsibilities for energy-related matters among various District departments, commissions, and agencies; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> To ensure a reliable and adequate supply of energy resources for the District’s citizens and economy; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The establishment of the District of Columbia Office of Energy is in the public interest and will promote the general welfare of the public by assuring coordinated and efficient management of the District’s energy policy and programs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> To establish the District of Columbia Office of Energy;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To provide for the development of a comprehensive energy plan, policy, and programs for the District of Columbia;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> To achieve effective management of energy functions of the District government through the District of Columbia Office of Energy in cooperation with the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia, the People’s Counsel of the District of Columbia, and all other appropriate District agencies and departments;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> To provide for the development of an emergency energy shortage contingency plan to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of District of Columbia citizens and industry during any public emergency, caused by an actual or impending acute shortage of usable energy resources; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> To encourage and ensure full and effective public participation in formulation and implementation of a District of Columbia energy policy.</p>
