                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The aggregate amount of the fines, charges, expenses, costs, penalties, and interest secured by the lien imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection may appear on a real property tax bill, and the aggregate amount shall be:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the lien has been converted to a real property tax lien under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1340.html">47-1340</a> or if the accrued amount of the lien appears on the real property tax bill, the real property tax lien shall be enforced under Chapter 13A of Title 47.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The Mayor may require the owner of vacant property in the District to fence or otherwise enclose the property to prevent the recurrence of a violation of any part of this chapter.</p>
