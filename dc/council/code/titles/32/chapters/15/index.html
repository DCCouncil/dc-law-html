If the report of such physician shows that the estimate of the former physician is improper or that the treatment recommended is not one that is generally recognized in the medical community, the Mayor shall have the power in his discretion to charge the cost of such examination to the employer, if he is a self-insurer, or to the insurance company which is carrying the risk, or, in appropriate cases, to the special fund.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> The employee and employer are entitled upon request to all medical reports made pursuant to claims arising under this chapter.</p>

If the employer or carrier refuse to accept such written recommendation, within 14 days after its receipt by them, they shall pay or tender to the employee in writing the additional compensation, if any, to which they believe the employee is entitled. If the employee refuses to accept such payment or tender of compensation and thereafter utilizes the services of an attorney-at-law, and if the compensation thereafter awarded is greater than the amount paid or tendered by the employer or carrier, a reasonable attorney’s fee based solely upon the difference between the amount awarded and the amount tendered or paid shall be awarded in addition to the amount of compensation. The foregoing sentence shall not apply if the controversy relates to degree or length of disability, and if the employer or carrier offers to submit the case for evaluation by physicians employed or selected by the Mayor, as authorized in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1507.html">32-1507</a>(e), and offers to tender an amount of compensation based upon the degree or length of disability found by the independent medical report at such time as an evaluation of disability can be made.

An approved attorney’s fee, in cases in which the obligation to pay the fee is upon the claimant, may be made a lien upon the compensation due under an award, and the Mayor or court shall fix in the award approving the fee such lien and manner of payment.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> There is established in the Treasury of the District of Columbia a special fund for the purpose of making payments in accordance with the provisions of §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1507.html">32-1507</a>(c), <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1507.html">32-1507</a>(e), <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1508.html">32-1508</a>(6), and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1519.html">32-1519</a>(b). Such fund shall be administered by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Mayor shall be the custodian of the special fund, and all moneys and securities in such fund shall be held in trust by the Mayor and shall not be used for purposes other than those provided by this chapter. The Mayor may invest any portion of the fund which, in the opinion of the Mayor, is not needed for current requirements in bonds or notes of the United States or any federal land bank; provided, that such investments are made pursuant to the Financial Institutions Deposit and Investment Act of 1997.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Neither the District of Columbia nor the Mayor shall be liable in respect of payments authorized under §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1507.html">32-1507</a>(c), <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1507.html">32-1507</a>(e), <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1508.html">32-1508</a>(6) and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1519.html">32-1519</a>(b) in any amount greater than the money or property deposited in or belonging to such fund.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Payments into such fund shall be made as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> Each employer shall pay $5,000 as compensation for the death of an employee of such employer resulting from injury where the Mayor determines that there is no person entitled under this chapter to compensation for such death;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> All amounts collected as fines and penalties under the provisions of this chapter shall be paid into such fund; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> The total assessment amount shall be allocated between self-insured employers and insured employers based on paid losses for the fiscal year preceding the year in which the assessment is based. The method of assessing self-insured employers shall be based upon paid losses. The method of assessing insured employers shall be a surcharge based on premium as set forth in this subsection. The portion of the total aggregate assessment to be collected from self-insured employers shall be equal to that proportion of the total paid losses during the preceding fiscal year, which the total paid losses of all self-insured employers bore to the total paid losses made by all self-insured employers and insurers on behalf of all insured employers during the preceding fiscal year. The portion of the total aggregate assessment that shall be collected from insured employers shall be equal to that proportion of total paid losses during the preceding fiscal year, which the total paid losses made on behalf of all insured employers bore to the total paid losses made by all self-insured employers and insurers on behalf of all insured employers during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> Any employer which becomes self-insured shall be assessed as if it were insured for 24 months after conversion. The new self-insured employer shall be assessed on the basis of premium. The premium basis shall be equal to its premium for the policy period immediately preceding conversion to be self-insured, multiplied by the percentage change in the self-insured’s payroll. The payroll measurement period shall be the fiscal year immediately preceding conversion and the subsequent 2 fiscal years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(5)">(5)</span> On or after September 1, 1999, and annually thereafter, the Mayor shall notify insurers of the premium surcharge rate to be effective for policies written or renewed on and after October 1, 1999, and annually thereafter. The Mayor shall notify self-insured employers, at the same time, of the amount to be assessed against self-insured employers for the following fiscal year. The assessment against self-insurers and the surcharge rate applicable to policies of insured employers, together with amounts generated by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, shall be sufficient to generate revenue needed to satisfy obligations to the Special Fund. Should the Mayor subsequently determine that the assessments are insufficient to meet the Special Fund’s obligations during a fiscal year, the Mayor may assess self-insurers and insured employers to cover any anticipated deficiency, based upon the allocation method set forth in this subsection. Self-insured employers and insurers, on behalf of their policyholders, shall remit any emergency assessment within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice from the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(6)">(6)</span> Every workers’ compensation insurer shall collect, from each of its policyholders, an amount equal to the insured employers’ assessment through a surcharge based on premium. These assessments shall include any amounts paid by insurers on behalf of their policyholders to cover an emergency assessment by the Mayor during the previous fiscal year. Assessments when collected shall not constitute an element of loss for the purpose of establishing rates for workers’ compensation insurance but, for the purpose of collection, shall be treated as separate costs imposed upon insured employers. The total of the assessment imposed by this subsection shall be stated as a separate cost on an insured employer’s policy, or on a separate document submitted to the insured employer, and shall be identified as the “Workers’ Compensation Policyholder Surcharge.” Each assessment shall be shown as a percentage of the total workers’ compensation policyholder premium. The premium surcharge shall be excluded from the definition of premiums for all purposes, including computation of agents’ commissions or premium taxes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(7)">(7)</span> Insurers and self-insurers shall forward to the Special Fund all amounts collected pursuant to this section. These collections shall be for the administration of the Special Fund and shall not be part of the General Fund of the District of Columbia. Any balance remaining at the end of any fiscal year shall not revert to the General Fund and shall be used exclusively to offset any Special Fund assessment required in the next immediate fiscal year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The special fund shall be audited annually by the Department of Employment Services. The Director of the Department of Employment Services shall file an audited financial report with the Council by March 1st detailing the financial status of the fund as of the end of the preceding fiscal year, including the fund’s operation, cash flow, and changes in capital and surplus, using standard accounting principles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> All civil penalties provided for in this chapter shall be collected by civil suit brought by the Mayor.</p>

              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>It shall be unlawful for any employer or his duly authorized agent to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an employee as to his employment because such employee has claimed or attempted to claim compensation from such employer, or because he has testified or is about to testify in a proceeding under this chapter. Any employer who violates this section shall be liable to a penalty of not less than $100 or more than $1,000, as may be determined by the Mayor. All such penalties shall be paid to the Mayor for deposit in the special fund as described in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1540.html">32-1540</a>, and if not paid may be recovered in a civil action brought in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Any employee so discriminated against shall be restored to his employment and shall be compensated by his employer for any loss of wages arising out of such discrimination; provided, that if such employee ceases to be qualified to perform the duties of his employment, he shall not be entitled to such restoration and compensation. The employer alone and not his carrier shall be liable for such penalties and payments. Any provision in an insurance policy undertaking to relieve the employer from liability for such penalties and payments shall be void.</p>
