The notification shall be furnished not later than 15 days after the date that coverage under the health benefits plan would otherwise terminate. Failure by an employer to furnish the notification shall not extend the right to continue coverage beyond the time provided for under this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The evidence of coverage or certificate of coverage furnished to employees by a health insurer shall include a statement advising the employee of his or her right to continue coverage as provided for under this chapter.</p>
