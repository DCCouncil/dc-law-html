                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The Board shall publish the proposed standard in the District of Columbia Register and afford interested persons, including employees or their representatives, a period of 30 days after publication of the standard in which to submit to the Board written comments. On or before the final day of the publication period, any interested person may file with the Board written objections to the proposed standard, stating the grounds for objection. The Board shall hold a public hearing upon any objection to a proposed standard and request for public hearing by publishing, within 30 days after the final day for filing objections, a notice in the District of Columbia Register specifying the time and place of the hearing.</p>

The rule shall be published in accordance with subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2. The rule may contain a provision delaying its effective date for a period of not more than 60 days to ensure that affected employers and employees are informed of the existence of the rule, its terms, and that affected employers have an opportunity to familiarize themselves and their employees with the existence and terms of the rule.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Whenever practicable, a rule promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall be based upon consideration of the highest safety and health protection standards for the employee, the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained from implementing this and other health and safety laws. In promulgating a rule on toxic materials or harmful physical agents pursuant to this subsection, the Board shall promulgate a rule that most adequately assures, to the extent feasible on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity, even if the employee has regular exposure to the toxic materials or physical agent throughout the working life of the employee. Whenever practicable, the rule promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and the performance desired.</p>
