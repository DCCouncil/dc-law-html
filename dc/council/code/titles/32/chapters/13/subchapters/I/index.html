                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(285) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Applicability of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/20-157.html">D.C. Law 20-157</a>: Section 7 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/20-157.html">D.C.

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> When an employee requests administrative enforcement of this chapter, the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Living Wage Act, and the Sick and Safe Leave Act, the Mayor shall investigate and make an initial determination regarding alleged violations. A signed complaint for non-payment of earned wages shall be filed with the Mayor, no later than 3 years after the last date upon which the violation of this chapter, the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Living Wage Act is alleged to have occurred or the date on which the employer provided the complainant with actual or constructive notice of the employee’s rights, whichever is later.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> If the alleged non-payment of earned wages violation is ongoing at the time of the filing of the complaint, the complaint may also seek recovery of amounts that accrue after the filing of the complaint. With regard to amounts that were due at the time the complaint was filed, an aggrieved employee may recover only those amounts that became lawfully due and payable within the 3-year period before the date the complaint was filed. This period is tolled during any period that the employer fails to provide the complainant with actual or constructive notice of the employee’s rights or on other equitable grounds.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The complaint shall set forth the facts upon which it is based with sufficient specificity to determine both that an allegation of non-payment of earned wages has been made and that the other criteria stated in this section have been met.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> In addition to the other requirements of the complaint set forth in this section, the complaint shall be sworn and shall include or attach the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)">(A)</span> The complainant’s name, address, and telephone number (or alternate address or telephone number if the complainant desires);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Sufficient information to enable the Mayor to identify the employer through District records, such as the employer’s name, business address, license plate number, or telephone number; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(C)">(C)</span> An explanation of the alleged violations, which may include the approximate or actual dates the violations occurred, the estimated total dollar amount of unpaid wages, and an explanation of how the total estimated amount of unpaid wages was calculated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> The Mayor shall request additional information from the complainant to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)(A)">(A)</span> Amend a charge deemed insufficient;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)(B)">(B)</span> Cure technical defects or omissions;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)(C)">(C)</span> Clarify or amplify allegations; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)(D)">(D)</span> Ensure that any violations related to or arising out of the subject matter set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original charge are adequately alleged in the complaint</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> The Mayor shall deliver the complaint and a written notice to each respondent upon completion. The written notice shall set forth the damages, penalties and other costs for which the respondent may be liable, the rights and obligations of the parties, and the process for contesting the complaint.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The Mayor shall also include an additional notice to employees stating that an investigation is being conducted and providing information to employees on how they may participate in the investigation. Upon receipt, the respondent shall post this additional notice for a period of at least 30 days.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Within 20 days of the date the complaint and written notice are mailed, the respondent shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)(A)">(A)</span> Admit that the allegations in the complaint are true and pay to complainant any unpaid wages or compensation and liquidated damages owed and pay to the Mayor any fine or penalty assessed; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)(B)">(B)</span> Deny the allegations in the complaint and request that the agency make an initial determination regarding the allegations in the complaint.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> If a respondent admits the allegations, the Mayor shall issue an administrative order requiring the respondent to pay any unpaid wages, compensation, liquidated damages, and fine or penalty owed and requiring the respondent to cure any violations. The Mayor may also proceed with any audit or subpoena to determine if the rights of employees other than the complainant have also been violated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> If a respondent denies the allegations, the respondent must notify the Mayor of that decision and may provide any written supporting evidence within 20 days of the date the complaint is mailed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)">(6)</span> If a respondent fails to respond to the allegations within 20 days of the date the complaint is delivered, the allegations in the complaint shall be deemed admitted and the Mayor shall issue an initial determination requiring the respondent to pay any unpaid wages, compensation, liquidated damages, and fine or penalty owed and requiring the respondent to cure any violations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(7)">(7)</span> The Mayor shall issue an initial determination within 60 days of the date the complaint is delivered. The initial determination shall set forth a brief summary of the evidence considered, the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, and an order detailing the amount owed by the respondent or other relief deemed appropriate, if any. The initial determination shall be provided to both parties and set forth the losing party’s right to appeal under this section or to seek other relief available under this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(8)">(8)</span> In addition to determining whether the complainant has demonstrated that the employer has violated one or more provisions of this chapter, or the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Living Wage Act, by applying the presumption required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-1305.html">32-1305</a>(b), the Mayor shall make an initial determination of whether the complainant is entitled to additional unpaid earned wages due to other District laws such as the Living Wage Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Minimum Wage Revision Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(9)">(9)</span> If the Mayor fails to issue an initial determination within 60 days of the filing of a complaint, the complainant shall have a right to request a formal hearing before an administrative law judge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> The Mayor shall work with the parties in an attempt to conciliate. Any conciliation agreement shall be between the respondent and the complainant and shall be reduced to an administrative order requiring the respondent to pay any unpaid wages, compensation, liquidated damages, and fine or penalty owed and requiring the respondent to cure any violations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> When an administrative order issued as a result of a conciliation agreement is subsequently breached, the Mayor or the complainant may enforce the administrative order pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Within 30 days of the issuance of the initial determination or administrative order, not issued as a result of conciliation, either party may file for a formal hearing before an administrative law judge. If the initial determination was not issued within the 60-day period specified in subsection (c)(7) of this section, a complainant may file for a formal hearing before an administrative law judge. An administrative law judge shall conduct a hearing to determine whether a violation of this chapter or the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Living Wage Act, or the Sick and Safe Leave Act has occurred. The hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days of a request, except that the administrative law judge shall issue an order based on the findings from the hearing. The administrative law judge may grant each party one discretionary continuance due to hardship or scheduling of up to 15 days. The administrative law judge may grant any other request for continuance only for good cause.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> The administrative law judge shall have the authority to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, compel the production of evidence, receive evidence, and consolidate 2 or more complaints into a single hearing where such complaints involve sufficiently similar allegations of fact to justify consolidation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> All parties shall appear at the hearing, with or without counsel, and may submit evidence, cross-examine witnesses, obtain issuance of subpoenas, and otherwise be heard. Testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath, and a transcript shall be made available at cost to any individual unless the case is sealed. Testimony may also be given and received by telephone.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> The burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence shall rest upon the complainant, but shall shift to the respondent when the following conditions are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(A)">(A)</span> A respondent failed to keep records of an employee’s hours worked, or records of compensation provided to an employee are imprecise, inadequate, missing, fraudulently prepared or presented, or are substantially incomplete; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(B)">(B)</span> A complainant presents evidence to show, as a matter of just and reasonable inference, the amount of work done or the extent of work done or what compensation is due for the work done.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> Where the conditions in paragraph 4(A) and (B) of this subsection are met, the respondent must present compelling evidence of the precise amount of work performed and exact compensation promised or present compelling evidence to negate the reasonableness of the inferences drawn from the complainant’s evidence.

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
