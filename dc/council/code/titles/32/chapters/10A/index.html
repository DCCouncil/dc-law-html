                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A complainant may recover only those amounts that became lawfully due and payable within the 3-year period before the date the complaint was filed; except, that if the alleged failure to provide a minimum work week is ongoing at the time of the filing of the complaint, the complainant may also seek recovery of those amounts that accrued during the pendency of the claim.</p>
