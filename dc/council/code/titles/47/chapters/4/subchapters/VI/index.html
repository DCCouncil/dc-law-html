                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> The last comprehensive study of District taxes occurred in 1998, and more recent tax changes have been somewhat piecemeal and sometimes made without regard to the system as a whole or knowledge of long-term effects.</p>
