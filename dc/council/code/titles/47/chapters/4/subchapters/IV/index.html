                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Study state and local tax systems and particular types of state and local taxes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Develop and recommend proposals for an increase in uniformity or compatibility of state and local tax laws with a view toward encouraging the simplification and improvement of state and local tax law and administration.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">4.</span><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The Commission shall submit to the Governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that state for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Each of the Commission’s budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth in equal shares; and the remainder in proportion to the amount of revenue collected by each party state and its subdivisions from income taxes, capital stock taxes, gross receipts taxes, sales and use taxes. In determining such amounts, the Commission shall employ such available public sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the Commission’s budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the sources used in obtaining information employed in applying the formula contained in this paragraph.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under paragraph 1(i) of this article; provided that the Commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Commission makes use of funds available to it under paragraph 1(i), the Commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The accounts of the Commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to prevent Commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">Article VII</span><span class="level-heading"> Uniform Regulations and Forms.</span> </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">1.</span> Whenever any two or more party states, or subdivisions of party states, have uniform or similar provisions of law relating to an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales or use tax, the Commission may adopt uniform regulations for any phase of the administration of such law, including assertion of jurisdiction to tax, or prescribing uniform tax forms. The Commission may also act with respect to the provisions of Article IV of this compact.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">2.</span> Prior to the adoption of any regulation, the Commission shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> As provided in its bylaws, hold at least one public hearing on due notice to all affected party states and subdivisions thereof and to all taxpayers and other persons who have made timely request of the Commission for advance notice of its regulation-making proceedings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Afford all affected party states and subdivisions and interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant written data and views, which shall be considered fully by the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">3.</span> The Commission shall submit any regulations adopted by it to the appropriate officials of all party states and subdivisions to which they might apply. Each such state and subdivision shall consider any such regulation for adoption in accordance with its own laws and procedures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">Article VIII</span><span class="level-heading"> Interstate Audits.</span> </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">1.</span> This article shall be in force only in those party states that specifically provide therefor by statute.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">2.</span> Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records, or other documents, may request the Commission to perform the audit on its behalf. In responding to the request, the Commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise. The Commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit. The Commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">3.</span> The Commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, documents, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit. If the person is not within the jurisdiction, he may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the Commission within the state of which he is a resident; provided, that such state has adopted this article.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">4.</span> The Commission may apply through the Mayor of the District of Columbia, to any court in the District of Columbia having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this article, if the party or subject matter on account of which the Commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the courts of the District of Columbia. The Commission may apply for such order to the courts of the state or subdivision thereof, other than the District of Columbia, on behalf of which the audit is being made, or in which the party or subject matter being sought is situated, to the extent that the Commission is authorized to do so by the laws of such other state. Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court.</p>
