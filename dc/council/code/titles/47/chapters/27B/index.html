                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A feepayer that is exempt from taxation pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1802.01.html">47-1802.01</a> shall not be subject to the ballpark fee unless, as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1802.01.html">47-1802.01</a>, the feepayer has unrelated business income subject to tax under section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, approved August 16, 1954 (68A Stat. 169; 26 U.S.C. § 511). If the feepayer exempt from taxation has unrelated business income, the feepayer shall remit the ballpark fee based upon the feepayer’s annual District gross receipts that were associated with the feepayer’s unrelated business income for the feepayer’s preceding fiscal year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The amount of the ballpark fee shall be computed according to the following schedule:</p>

If the amount estimated to be collected is less than $14 million plus any amount necessary to replenish any reserve funds in accordance with the financing documents and to avoid any projected shortfall in debt service on the bonds, the Chief Financial Officer shall compute the amount of the ballpark fee under the schedule set forth in subsection (b) of this section needed to provide estimated revenue in the current fiscal year equal to $14 million plus any amount necessary to replenish any reserve funds in accordance with the financing documents and to avoid any projected shortfall in debt service on the bonds, by applying the same percentage increase to each amount of the then-current ballpark fee under the schedule set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The Chief Financial Officer shall notify the Council, the Mayor, and the feepayers of the new schedule and, upon such notice, the amount of the ballpark fee under the schedule set forth in subsection (b) of this section shall be increased as of October 1 of the current fiscal year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The revenues received by the District from the ballpark fee imposed by this section shall be deposited into the Ballpark Revenue Fund.</p>
