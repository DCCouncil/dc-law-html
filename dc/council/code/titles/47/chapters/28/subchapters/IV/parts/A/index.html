                    <p>The Council of the District of Columbia is authorized, in connection with the licensing of persons engaged in the home improvement business, whether as principal, agent, salesman, employee, or otherwise, to require the furnishing of bond as a condition to the issuance of such license. For the purposes of this part, the term “home improvement business” means the repair, remodeling, alteration, conversion, or modernization of, or addition to, residential property, all as may be more particularly defined in regulations promulgated by the Council. Such bonding may be required notwithstanding the fact that a person may also be subject to the bonding requirements of any other law.</p>

In connection with the licensing of persons to engage in the home improvement business, and the bonding of the members of any such class or subclass of such persons, the Council, in its discretion, may by regulation require applicants for licenses or licensees:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> To furnish and keep in force a bond or bonds running to the District, or other security acceptable to the Council, to protect members of the public against financial loss by reason of the failure of the licensee or of any officer, agent, employee, salesman, or other person acting on behalf of said licensee, to observe any law or regulation in force in the District of Columbia applicable to the licensee’s conduct of the licensed business;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To procure and keep in force public liability insurance or property damage insurance, or both; and</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Any person aggrieved by the violation of any law or regulation applicable to the licensee’s conduct of the licensed activity shall have, in addition to his right of action against such licensee, a right to bring suit against the surety on a bond authorized by this section, either alone or jointly with the principal thereon, and to recover in an amount not exceeding the penalty of the bond any damages sustained by reason of any act, transaction, or conduct of the licensee, or of any officer, agent, employee, salesman, or other person acting on behalf of said licensee, which is in violation of law or regulation in force in the District relating to the licensed activity. The provisions of the second, third, and fifth paragraphs of subsection (b) of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-301.01.html">1-301.01</a> shall be applicable to each bond authorized by this section as if it were the bond authorized by the first paragraph of such subsection (b) of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-301.01.html">1-301.01</a>; provided, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impose upon the surety on any such bond a greater liability than the total amount thereof or the amount remaining unextinguished after any prior recovery or recoveries.</p>
