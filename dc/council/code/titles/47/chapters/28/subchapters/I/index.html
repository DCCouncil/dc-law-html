The Health Department of the District of Columbia, including the office of the head thereof, was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 57 of the Board of Commissioners, dated June 30, 1953, and Reorganization Order No. 52, dated June 30, 1953, combined and redesignated Organization Order No. 141, dated February 11, 1964, established under the direction and control of a Commissioner, a Department of Public Health headed by a Director, for the purpose of planning, implementing, and directing public health and hospital care programs, and for performing certain other allied medical and paramedical functions. The Anatomical Board was established under the direction and control of the Director of Public Health consisting of members as prescribed in the D.C. Code. The Order prior to redesignation abolished the previously existing Health Department, Gallinger Hospital, Glenn Dale Sanatorium, and the Anatomical Board and transferred their functions and positions to the new Department. The organization of the new Department was set out in the Order. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. Functions stated in Organization Order No. 141 were transferred to the Director of the Department of Human Resources by Commissioner’s Order No. 69-96, dated March 7, 1969, as amended by Commissioner’s Order No. 70-83, dated March 6, 1970. The Department of Human Resources was replaced by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1979, dated February 21, 1980, which Plan established the Department of Human Services.</div>

Any person who goes from house to house, or place to place, within the District of Columbia, selling or taking orders for or offering to sell or take orders for goods, wares, merchandise, or any article or thing of value for future delivery, or for services to be performed in the future or for the making, manufacturing, or repairing of any article or thing whatsoever for future delivery, and requiring or accepting a deposit for such future delivery or service, shall be deemed to be a “solicitor,” within the meaning of this section; provided, however, that this definition shall not apply to persons selling goods, wares, merchandise, or any article or thing of value for resale to retailers in that commodity. Any person desiring a solicitor’s license shall make application to the Mayor of the District of Columbia or his designated agent on forms to be provided for that purpose, stating the name of the applicant, the name and address of the person whom he represents, the class and kind of goods offered for sale, or the kind of service to be performed. Such application shall be accompanied by a bond in the penal sum of $500, running to the District of Columbia, conditioned upon the making of final delivery of the goods ordered, or services to be performed, in accordance with the terms of such order, or failing therein, that the advance payment on such order be refunded. Any person aggrieved by the action of any such solicitor shall have the right of action on the bond for the recovery of money, or damages, or both. All orders taken by licensed solicitors shall be in writing in duplicate, stating the terms thereof and the amount paid in advance, and 1 copy shall be given to the purchaser.</span>
