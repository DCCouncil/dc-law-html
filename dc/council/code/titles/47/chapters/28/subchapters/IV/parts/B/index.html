For the purpose of making such examinations or investigations, the Mayor and his duly designated representatives shall have authority to require by subpoena the production of books, papers, and records and the attendance, and examination under oath, of all persons whomsoever whose testimony they may require relative to the loans or business of any such licensee, and shall have free access to the accounts, papers, records, files, safes, vaults, offices, and places of business used in connection with any business conducted under any license issued in accordance with this part. In the event of contumacy or refusal to obey any such subpoena or requirement under this section, the Mayor may make application to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for an order requiring obedience thereto. Thereupon the Court, with or without notice and hearing, as it in its discretion may decide, may make such order as is proper and may punish as a contempt any failure to comply with such order.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Each licensee shall annually, on or before the 15th day of March, file with the Mayor a report giving such information as the Mayor may require, relevant to the business and operations during the preceding calendar year of each licensed place of business conducted by such licensee in the District. Such report shall be made under oath and in the form prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor shall make and publish annually an analysis and recapitulation of such reports.</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor is authorized to appoint such assistants, clerks, or other employees as may be required for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this part.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Any person aggrieved by any action, decision, or ruling of the Mayor under this part may, within 20 days thereafter, or within 20 days after the service upon such person of any written decision and findings required by this part, appeal to the Mayor for a review thereof. Upon any such review, the Mayor may affirm, set aside, or modify such action, decision, or ruling. In any such case the Mayor shall, within 10 days thereafter, prepare a written decision and findings with respect thereto, containing a summary of the evidence and the reasons supporting the affirmance, setting aside, or modification, and forthwith serve upon the aggrieved person a copy thereof.</p>
