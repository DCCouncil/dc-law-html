                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <p>Board of Registration for Professional Engineers abolished. The District of Columbia Board of Registration for Professional Engineers was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. The functions were delegated to the Department of Occupations and Professions by Reorganization Order No. 59, dated June 30, 1953. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. Section 402 (64), (65), (66), (67) and (68) of the Plan transferred the regulatory and other functions of the Board of Commissioners, under § 47-2886.08, to the District of Columbia Council to the extent and in the particulars specified in that section, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided by § 406 of the Plan. The functions delegated the Department of Occupations and Professions were subsequently transferred to the Director of the Department of Economic Development by Commissioner’s Order No. 69-96, dated March 7, 1969. The Department of Economic Development was replaced by Mayor’s Order 78-42, dated February 17, 1978, which Order established the Department of Licenses, Investigation and Inspection.</p>
                <p>The functions of the Department of Licenses, Investigations and Inspections were transferred to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983.</p>

Such registration shall entitle the holder to engage in the practice of engineering only for the duration of and in connection with a specific project for which it was granted, and shall be subject to annual renewal and to suspension or revocation as registration granted as otherwise provided in this part. Engineers to whom such temporary registration has been granted shall be separately listed in the roster;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> To require all candidates for registration as professional engineers to file with the Secretary-Treasurer of the Board a written application on a prescribed form and accompanied by the required fee. Such application shall contain statements made under oath, showing the applicant’s education, detailed summary of his experience in engineering work, and the general field or fields of engineering in which he has his principal activity, and shall contain not less than 5 references, of whom 3 or more shall be engineers having personal knowledge of his engineering training and experience;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> To investigate the allegations contained in any application for registration as a professional engineer in order to determine the truth of such allegations, and to determine the competency of any person applying for a registration to assume responsible charge of the work involved in the practice of engineering, such competency to be determined by the grade and character of the engineering work actually performed. Any person having the necessary qualifications prescribed in this part to entitle him to registration or certification shall be eligible therefor, although he may not be practicing his profession at the time of making his application. Evaluation of experience in engineering shall be based upon the applicant’s knowledge of the fundamental engineering subjects, which shall be broad in scope and of a nature to develop and mature the applicant’s engineering knowledge and judgment. In considering the qualifications of an applicant who has graduated in engineering from an approved institution, each year, but not exceeding 2 years, of successful postgraduate study in engineering, and each scholastic year, in excess of 4, of an approved 5- or 6-year engineering curriculum, and each year of teaching engineering subjects, in an approved institution, may be considered as equivalent to 1 year of experience in engineering. In considering the qualifications of an applicant who is an undergraduate in engineering, or who has graduated in a curriculum other than engineering, from an approved institution, each equivalent year of approved engineering education, as determined by evaluation by the Board of the educational records submitted, may be considered as equivalent to 2 years of combined education and experience in engineering. Experience in engineering gained under the supervision of a professional engineer or similarly qualified engineer, and experience in engineering gained subsequent to the attaining of an equivalent to the minimum requirements for certification as an engineer-in-training, of a grade and character satisfactory to the Board, shall be given full credit. In any case when the evidence presented in the application does not appear to the Board conclusive nor warranting the issuance of a certificate of registration or a certificate as engineer-in-training without examination, the applicant may be required to present further evidence for the consideration of the Board, and may also be required to pass an oral or written examination, or both, as the Board may determine. Whenever the Board determines otherwise than by examination that an applicant has not produced sufficient evidence to show that he is competent to assume responsible charge of the work involved in the practice of engineering, and shall refuse to examine or to register such applicant, it shall set forth in writing its findings and the reasons for its conclusions, and furnish a copy thereof to the applicant;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> To prescribe the scope, manner, time, and place for the examination of applicants for registration as professional engineers, to provide for the conduct of and to conduct such examinations, and to make written reports of such examinations. The prescribed examinations shall be written, or written and oral, and designed to permit an applicant for registration as a professional engineer to take the examination in 2 stages. The 1st stage of the examination shall be designed to test the applicant’s knowledge of fundamental engineering subjects, including mathematics, physical and applied sciences, properties of materials, and the principles of engineering design. Satisfactory passing of this portion of the examination shall constitute a credit for the life of the applicant or until he is registered as a professional engineer. The 2nd stage of the examination shall be designed to test the applicant’s ability to apply the principles of engineering to the actual practice of engineering in the field of engineering in which he has indicated his principal activity. An applicant failing to pass an examination may apply for reexamination at the expiration of 6 months and will be reexamined upon payment of the prescribed fee;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> To issue a certificate of registration and a pocket registration card to each professional engineer granted registration under the provisions of this part.

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(69) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
