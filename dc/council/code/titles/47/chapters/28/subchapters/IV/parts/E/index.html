The Mayor shall accept the application for renewal from the other State as an application for renewal in the District of Columbia if the application to the other State:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Was submitted in the other State within 6 months next preceding the filing in the District of Columbia and the applicant certifies the information contained in the application for renewal is current;</p>
