                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Upon having a substantive discussion about a specific property or properties with an actual or prospective buyer or seller who is not the client of the licensee, a licensee shall disclose any broker relationship the licensee has with another party to the transaction. The disclosure shall be made in writing at the earliest practical time, but in no event later than the time when specific real estate assistance is first provided, and shall be substantially in the form determined by the Board by regulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> A licensee shall disclose to an actual or prospective landlord or tenant, who is not the client of the licensee, that the licensee has a brokerage relationship with another party or parties to the transaction. The disclosure shall be in writing and included in all applications for lease or in the lease itself, whichever occurs first. If the terms of the lease do not provide for disclosure, disclosure shall be made in writing no later than the signing of lease. This disclosure requirement shall not apply to lessors or lessees in single or multifamily residential units for lease terms of less than 2 months.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> If a licensee’s relationship to a client or customer changes, the licensee shall disclose that fact in writing to all clients and customers already involved in the specific contemplated transaction.</p>
