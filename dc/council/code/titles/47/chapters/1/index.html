                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Disbursing Office abolished: The Disbursing Office was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 3 of the Board of Commissioners, dated August 28, 1952, established under the direction and control of the Board of Commissioners a Department of General Administration headed by a Director. The Order transferred to the Director of General Administration all of the functions of the abolished Office. Reorganization Order No. 20 established the Finance Office in the Department of General Administration. Included in the Finance Office were an Office of the Assessor, the Office of the Collector of Taxes, the Disbursing Office, and the Accounting Office headed by an Accounting Officer. The function of approving vouchers and requisitions was delegated to the Accounting Officer by that Order. Reorganization Order No. 20 was replaced by Organization Order No. 121. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. Reorganization Order No. 3 and Organization Order No. 121 were revoked by Organization Order No. 3 of the Commissioner of the District of Columbia, dated December 13, 1967. Organization Order No. 3 established within the newly created Department of General Administration a Finance Office and prescribed the functions thereof. These functions were subsequently transferred to the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue by Commissioner’s Order No. 69-96, dated March 7, 1969. Functions pertaining to centralized accounting (including approving vouchers and requisitions) as set forth in that Order were transferred to the Director of the Office of Budget and Financial Management by Organization Order No. 30, dated April 5, 1972. The Office of Budget and Financial Management was replaced by Organization Order 50, dated December 31, 1974, which Order established the Office of Budget and Management Systems. The disbursing and accounting functions of the Office of Budget and Management Systems were replaced by Mayor’s Order 79-6, dated January 2, 1979, which Order established the Office of Financial Management. The Office of Financial Management was then re-established by 47-314 on March 5, 1981.</p>

Each such audit shall be conducted by a certified public accountant licensed in the District of Columbia and carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and the financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>

Thereafter, each individual elected as Mayor in a general election held for Mayor of the District of Columbia shall on or after January 2nd next following his or her election to, and the assuming of the Office of Mayor, select, subject to the advice and consent of the Council of the District of Columbia, a qualified person to conduct such audits for the fiscal year commencing October 1st of the calendar year in which the Mayor takes office, and the next following 3 fiscal years. The person previously selected for a 4-year period shall not succeed himself or herself. If the Council fails to act, by resolution on any such selection within a 30-day period following the date on which it receives from the Mayor the name of such person so selected, the Mayor shall be authorized to enter into a contract with that person for the conduct of such audits. If any person so selected by the Mayor to conduct any such audits for such fiscal years is rejected by the Council, the Mayor shall submit to the Council the name of another qualified person selected by the Mayor to conduct such audits. In the event that the Council rejects the 2nd person so selected by the Mayor, the Mayor shall, within 30 days following that rejection, notify the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, in writing, of that fact. Within 15 days following the receipt of that notice, such Chairmen shall jointly select a person to conduct such audits and shall inform the Mayor, in writing, of the name of the person so selected. Within 10 days following the receipt by the Mayor of such name, the Mayor shall enter into a contract with such person pursuant to which that person shall conduct such audits for such fiscal years as herein provided.</p>
