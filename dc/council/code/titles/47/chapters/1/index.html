                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Mayor may enter into an agreement with the United States Secretary of the Treasury to participate in the Treasury Offset Program. The offset agreement may provide for the collection of any delinquent debt owed to the District of Columbia from federal payments payable to the debtor. The offset agreement may also provide for the United States to submit requests to the District for delinquent nontax debts owed to federal agencies to be offset against District of Columbia payments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor may authorize the Chief Financial Officer to reduce a District of Columbia payment by the amount of any federal nontax debt amount requested by the United States to be offset by the District in accordance with the offset agreement.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Determine if a person for whom the offset request is received is due a District of Columbia payment;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Authorize the Chief Financial Officer to withhold a District of Columbia payment that is otherwise due to the person for whom an offset request has been received;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Authorize the Chief Financial Officer to pay to the federal official the lesser of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The entire District of Columbia payment, less any offset fee authorized by the offset agreement; or</p>
