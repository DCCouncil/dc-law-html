                <p>“Sec. 4402. No later than September 30, 2001, the following agencies and agencies responsible for the following programs, shall submit to the Council of the District of Columbia and to the Chief Financial Officer a multiyear financial plan as required by this title:</p>
                <p>“(1) Risk Management programs administered by the Mayor;</p>
                <p>“(2) Department of Mental Health; and</p>
                <p>“(3) Settlements and Judgments Fund administered by the Corporation Counsel.</p>
                <p>“Sec. 4403. The multiyear financial plan required by this title shall detail the projected cost of services for that agency or program for fiscal years 2002 through 2005, and shall be based on a performance plan for the same fiscal years. The multiyear financial plan shall specify reasonable assumptions for inflation, personal service levels, and wage increases, and identify all budgetary assumptions being used. The multiyear financial plan shall calculate and specify the cost per fiscal year to achieve the objectives and goals set forth in the performance plan.</p>
                <p>“Sec. 4404. (a) For the purposes of this title, ‘performance plan’ is a detailed statement that includes:</p>
                <p>“(1) A mission statement—a broad statement of central purpose;</p>
                <p>“(2) Objectives—less broad statements of desired outcomes resulting from accomplishing the mission; and</p>
                <p>“(3) Goals—target levels of performance expressed in tangible, measurable terms, against which actual achievement of objectives can be compared; a goal may be expressed as a population target, or as a quantitative standard, value, or rate.</p>
                <p>“(b) The performance plan shall describe the strategy for how the mission (including its objectives and goals) will be accomplished. This description of strategy shall include all of the functions, activities, operations, and projects required for effective implementation of the performance plan. There shall be one or more measures of performance, that address both quantity and quality, for each goal. The performance plan shall state measurable or objective performance goals and objectives for all significant activities of the agency or program. The plan shall identify(describe and quantify) the classes of persons to be served and how(qualitatively and quantitatively) those classes will change as a result of the mission, objectives, and goals.</p>
                <p>“(c) The performance plan shall also provide national norms, industry standards, typical benchmarks, performance measures from other cities, or other relevant comparative data.</p>
                <p>“(d) An agency which prepared a performance plan pursuant to Title XLIV of the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Support Act of 2000, effective October 19, 2000 (<a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/13-172.html">D.C. Law 13-172</a>;  47 DCR 6308), in the previous fiscal year shall also provide an analysis of the agency’s performance vis-à-vis its performance plan.</p>
                <p>“Sec. 4405. The multiyear financial plan shall include all funds, including local and federal funds.</p>
                <p>“Sec. 4406. For each of the agencies specified in section 4402, the performance plan shall detail how the agency or program will provide improved service delivery that:</p>
                <p>“(1) Fulfills its mission (including objectives and goals);</p>
                <p>“(2) Reduces expenditures, especially from local funds; and</p>
                <p>“(3) Creates operational efficiencies to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>“Sec. 4407. The Chief Financial Officer shall have the authority to require greater specificity in the multiyear plan prior to submission, and to work with agencies to improve their submission.”</p>

                <p>Application of § 11603(b) of Pub. L. 105-33: Section 11603(c) of title XI of Pub.

The District shall spend the funds from the Reserve in such a way that an appropriate balance is available in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quarters to ensure balance between revenues and expenditures at year end.
