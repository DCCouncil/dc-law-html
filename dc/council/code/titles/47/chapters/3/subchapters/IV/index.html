Additional Council approval shall be required for additional reprogrammings which individually or considered on a cumulative basis would result in additional changes of more than $50,000 to the original appropriated or estimated non-appropriated authority of any responsibility centers within the Department of Human Services.</p>
                <p>“(e)(1) The Mayor shall transmit reprogramming requests as provided in subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section to the Chairman of the Council, who shall immediately circulate the requests to the members of the Council.</p>

                <p>“(B) The publication of the ‘notice of a reprogramming request’ pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall satisfy the public notice requirements of this section and the rules of the Council and no further notice shall be necessary for the Council to adopt a resolution affecting the reprogramming request.</p>
                <p>“(5) At any time prior to final action by the Council on a reprogramming request submitted pursuant to this subchapter, or prior to a reprogramming becoming effective without Council action as provided in this subchapter, the Mayor may withdraw the reprogramming request.</p>
                <p>“(e-1) Reprogrammings transmitted to the Council pursuant to subsections (a), (b), (c), and (e) of this section shall include a specific listing of responsibility centers and control centers, or both, from which funds are being reduced and a specific listing of responsibility centers and control centers, or both, to which funds are being added. Each separate reprogramming request shall be for the total net sum of zero dollars.</p>
                <p>“(f) If the Council disapproves a reprogramming request the Mayor may, on a clear showing of changed circumstances, new information, or additional administrative hardship, ask for a reconsideration of the previous action of the Council. The Council may at its discretion reconsider its previous action.</p>
                <p>“(g) All reprogrammings which occur, regardless of amount, shall be reported by the Mayor to the Council on a monthly basis. A monthly reprogramming summary shall set forth clearly and concisely each reprogramming activity by original object category and new object category. It shall specify the amount of funds shifted and other consequences where appropriate (such as personnel shifts, equipment transfers, etc.). The monthly reprogramming summary shall also include a brief explanation of the administrative necessity that was served by the reprogramming activity. The Mayor shall be responsible for assembling and transmitting the monthly reprogramming summary. The Council committee staff responsible for the budget process shall receive and analyze the monthly reprogramming summary.</p>
                <p>“(h) The District of Columbia Board of Education, and the Board of Trustees of the University of the District of Columbia shall be excluded for appropriated authority and the District of Columbia Board of Education, the Board of Trustees of the University of the District of Columbia for estimated nonappropriated authority shall be excluded from the provisions of this section; provided, that reprogramming requests in excess of the thresholds established pursuant to section 109 of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2003, approved February 20, 2003 (Pub.
