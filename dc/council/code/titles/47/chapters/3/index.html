Gap-closing actions include increases in current revenue bases and rates; new taxes, fees, charges, fines, forfeitures, and penalties; expenditure reductions associated with lower service levels; and productivity improvements that yield expenditure reductions without a decrease in service levels.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> If the Council rejects gap-closing actions of the Mayor either in the annual budget request or any budget modification, it must substitute 1 or more of its own gap-closing actions to make up the amount of the rejected gap-closing actions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Within 30 days after the end of each month, the Mayor shall provide the Council with a progress report on those gap-closing actions that the Council designates for monitoring.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The Mayor shall replace, in the Mayor’s budget modification submission, any gap-closing actions that the Council determines to be in serious danger of failure with gap-closing actions more likely to occur. However, the Mayor may not replace gap-closing actions approved by the Council in any budget adoption process merely because the Mayor does not support such actions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> If the Mayor determines that the budget gap has increased from the submission of the Mayor’s budget request to the submission of the first budget modification, or from the submission of 1 budget modification to the submission of another, the Mayor must increase the aggregate dollar value of the gap-closing actions to cover the difference. If the Mayor determines that the budget gap has decreased from the submission of the Mayor’s budget request to the submission of the first budget modification, or from the submission of 1 budget modification to the submission of another, the Mayor may decrease the aggregate dollar value of the gap-closing actions to eliminate the difference.</p>

Should no written notice of disapproval of such request(s) be filed with the Secretary to the Council within 14 calendar days of the receipt of a request from the Mayor, or no oral notice of disapproval is given during a meeting of the Council during such 14 calendar day period, the request shall be deemed to be approved. Should notice of disapproval be given during such initial 14-calendar day period, the Council may approve or disapprove the reprogramming request by resolution within 30 calendar days of the initial receipt of the request from the Mayor, or such request shall be deemed to be approved.</p>
                <p>“(3) No request may be submitted to the Chairman of the Council under this subsection during such time as the Council is on recess, according to its rules, nor shall any time period provided in this subsection or in the Council’s rules with respect to the requests continue to run during such time as the Council is on recess.</p>
                <p>“(4)(A) Upon receipt of a reprogramming request submitted pursuant to this subchapter, the Chairman of the Council shall cause a ‘notice of a reprogramming request’ to be published in the District of Columbia Register, together with a statement that the request will be deemed approved 14 days from the date of its receipt unless a ‘notice of disapproval’ has been filed prior to that time by any member of the Council, and if such ‘notice of disapproval’ has been filed, that the request will be deemed approved 30 days from the date of the receipt of the reprogramming request unless prior to that time the Council has adopted a resolution of disapproval or approval.</p>
                <p>“(B) The publication of the ‘notice of a reprogramming request’ pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall satisfy the public notice requirements of this section and the rules of the Council and no further notice shall be necessary for the Council to adopt a resolution affecting the reprogramming request.</p>
                <p>“(5) At any time prior to final action by the Council on a reprogramming request submitted pursuant to this subchapter, or prior to a reprogramming becoming effective without Council action as provided in this subchapter, the Mayor may withdraw the reprogramming request.</p>
                <p>“(e-1) Reprogrammings transmitted to the Council pursuant to subsections (a), (b), (c), and (e) of this section shall include a specific listing of responsibility centers and control centers, or both, from which funds are being reduced and a specific listing of responsibility centers and control centers, or both, to which funds are being added. Each separate reprogramming request shall be for the total net sum of zero dollars.</p>
                <p>“(f) If the Council disapproves a reprogramming request the Mayor may, on a clear showing of changed circumstances, new information, or additional administrative hardship, ask for a reconsideration of the previous action of the Council. The Council may at its discretion reconsider its previous action.</p>
                <p>“(g) All reprogrammings which occur, regardless of amount, shall be reported by the Mayor to the Council on a monthly basis. A monthly reprogramming summary shall set forth clearly and concisely each reprogramming activity by original object category and new object category. It shall specify the amount of funds shifted and other consequences where appropriate (such as personnel shifts, equipment transfers, etc.). The monthly reprogramming summary shall also include a brief explanation of the administrative necessity that was served by the reprogramming activity. The Mayor shall be responsible for assembling and transmitting the monthly reprogramming summary. The Council committee staff responsible for the budget process shall receive and analyze the monthly reprogramming summary.</p>
                <p>“(h) The District of Columbia Board of Education, and the Board of Trustees of the University of the District of Columbia shall be excluded for appropriated authority and the District of Columbia Board of Education, the Board of Trustees of the University of the District of Columbia for estimated nonappropriated authority shall be excluded from the provisions of this section; provided, that reprogramming requests in excess of the thresholds established pursuant to section 109 of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2003, approved February 20, 2003 (Pub. L. 108-7; 117 Stat. 122 ), shall be submitted to the Mayor and the Council for review and comment prior to their transmittal to the Congress.</p>
                <p>“(i)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, a reprogramming request made as part of performance-based budgeting shall be approved by the Mayor and Council pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-308.01.html">47-308.01</a> and this subsection.</p>
