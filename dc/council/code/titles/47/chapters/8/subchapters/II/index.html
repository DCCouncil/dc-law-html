To be eligible for such deferral the taxpayer must:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Have owned for at least 1 year the property for which the deferral is claimed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Certify that such property is currently occupied by the taxpayer and that such property was occupied by the taxpayer for the 12 month period immediately preceding the application for deferral; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> File a written application for deferral on a form provided by the Mayor. An application for real property tax deferral shall be filed with the Mayor before the last date an installment payment of the real property taxes which are to be deferred is due.</p>

A taxpayer shall be eligible to start deferring portions of the increased property tax liability immediately after his or her application has been approved by the Mayor. If the application for deferral is disapproved, the taxpayer shall be notified, in writing, of said disapproval and the reasons therefor and granted an additional 30 days to pay said taxes without interest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Taxes deferred under this section shall bear simple interest at the rate of ½% per month or portion of a month until paid.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Taxes deferred under this section, together with all accumulated interest, shall constitute a preferential lien upon the real property which shall be immediately payable by the seller, transferor, or conveyor whenever the real property is sold, refinanced, transferred, or conveyed in any manner, or whenever additional co-owners (other than spouse or domestic partner) are added to the real property; except, that whenever such real property is sold, transferred, or conveyed to the mother, father, spouse, domestic partner, children by blood or legally adopted children of the seller, transferor, or conveyor, the deferred taxes lien, if not satisfied, shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Taxes, including penalty and interest thereon, deferred under this section shall constitute a preferential lien upon the real property which shall be payable immediately by the seller, transferor, or conveyor whenever the real property is sold, transferred, or conveyed in any manner, to an entity other than BNAW or a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNA or whenever additional co-owners (other than BNA or a wholly-owned subsidiary of BNA) are added to the real property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> In no event shall the deferral granted pursuant to this section be transferable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> As a condition to the grant of tax benefits under this section, BNA and BNAW shall submit to the Mayor by March 31st of each tax year an affidavit, signed under penalty of perjury.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The Mayor shall make an annual determination of the compliance by BNA and BNAW with the requirements of this section and the Agreement under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the Mayor determines that BNA and BNAW are in compliance, the Mayor shall issue to BNA and BNAW and to the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue (“Director”) a certificate of compliance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If the Mayor determines that BNA and BNAW are not in compliance, and after the Mayor gives to BNA and BNAW written notice and a reasonable time to cure the noncompliance or default and BNA and BNAW fail to cure the noncompliance or default, the Mayor shall issue to BNA and BNAW and to the Director a certificate of noncompliance and shall direct that BNA and BNAW be billed for the assessment based on the accumulated tax liability as if the deferment had not been approved.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The Mayor is authorized to develop the necessary forms and procedures, and to promulgate regulations, necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> For purposes of this section, the term:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> “Eligible owner” means an owner (or owners):</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Who resides in the District in a house or condominium; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Whose household adjusted gross income is less than $50,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> “Household adjusted gross income” means the adjusted gross income of all persons residing in a household, as determined by each person’s federal income tax year ending immediately before the beginning of the real property tax year during which application is made under subsection (e) of this section, excluding the adjusted gross income of any person who is a tenant by virtue of a written lease for fair market value.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, an eligible owner may defer for each tax year any real property tax in excess of the real property tax for the prior tax year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Real property tax deferred under this section shall bear simple interest at the rate of 1/2% per month or portion of a month until paid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Real property tax shall not be deferred if the aggregate amount of the deferred real property tax, including interest thereon, under this section, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-845.html">47-845</a>, and § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-845.03.html">47-845.03</a> is equal to or greater than 25% of the assessed value of the real property for the tax year (or half tax year for which the deferral would otherwise continue).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> To qualify to receive the deferral, the eligible owner shall complete and file with the Mayor an application in a form prescribed by the Mayor. The eligible owner shall certify, under penalty of perjury, the information provided on the application form and the application form shall be filed in the manner prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor may require the eligible owner to provide any information which the Mayor considers necessary, including all taxpayer identification numbers of the eligible owner, any other owner, any person with legal or equitable title, and any person in the household of the eligible owner. The Mayor may also require eligible owner, any person with legal or equitable title, and any person in the household of the individual to submit information after the deferral has been granted to determine whether the eligible owner continues to be entitled to the deferral.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> If a properly completed and approved application is filed during the period October 1 through March 31 of the tax year, the eligible owner shall receive the deferral for the entire tax year. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, if a properly completed and approved application is filed during the period April 1 through September 30, the eligible household shall receive 1/2 of the deferral, which shall be applied to the second installment only.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The application form filed by the individual, shareholder, or member shall apply to the initial tax year or initial second-half tax year, and to any succeeding tax year thereafter, for which the deferral is granted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the eligible owner no longer qualifies for the deferral, the eligible owner shall notify the Mayor of the date of the change in eligibility within 30 days after the change in eligibility and the amount of the deferred tax, plus interest at the rate provided in subsection (c) of this section, for the tax year in which the change in eligibility occurred shall be paid within 30 days of the change in eligibility. If the applicant fails to notify the Mayor timely, the amount of the deferred tax, plus interest thereon, shall bear interest at the rate provided for the payment of delinquent real property taxes, plus applicable penalties thereon.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, if the real property of the eligible owner is transferred and continues to qualify for the deferral 30 days or less before the date of execution of the deed of transfer, the eligible owner shall not be required to notify the Mayor of the change in eligibility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the change in eligibility occurs during the period October 1 through March 31 of the tax year, the deferral shall be disallowed for the entire tax year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If the change in eligibility occurs during the period April 1 through September 30, the deferral shall be disallowed for 1/2 of the tax year.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If a filed application is properly completed and not disapproved, taxes deferred shall remain deferred and the taxes from prospective tax years shall continue to be deferred notwithstanding household adjusted gross income applicable to prospective tax years that exceeds the threshold in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> This paragraph shall not apply if the senior’s household no longer qualifies for the deferral for any other reason.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> There shall be a lien on the real property in the amount of the deferred real property tax, at the rate as provided in subsection (c) of this section or subsection (h) of this section, as applicable, and any penalties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Deferred real property tax, interest thereon, and any penalties, shall be payable upon the transfer of the real property. Real property that is not transferred within one year from the date of death of the eligible owner shall be deemed transferred. Real property tax together, and interest thereon, that is not paid within 5 days of the date of transfer shall be deemed delinquent real property tax.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The eligibility of an eligible owner for the deferral shall not be affected by the transfer of the real property into a revocable trust if the transfer is without consideration and the real property remains the residence of the eligible owner before and after the transfer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> If an eligible owner claims a deferral for more than one real property in the same tax year, and has not timely notified the Mayor of all changes in eligibility, the Mayor shall disallow the deferral for each real property claimed by the eligible owner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span> Section 47-863(k) shall apply in the case of a deferral under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m)</span> The real property tax bill shall indicate whether the real property is receiving the deferral under this section. Any tax certificate shall indicate whether the real property is receiving the deferral under this section and the amount of deferred real property tax, interest thereon, and penalties. If a tax certificate does not contain the foregoing information, the eligible owner, and not the real property, shall be personally liable for the amount of deferred real property tax, interest thereon, and penalties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(n)</span> Any taxpayer who is 65 years of age or older and who applies for real property tax deferral under this section shall have undergone counseling as described in section 255 of the National Housing Act, approved February 5, 1988 (101 Stat. 1908; 12 U.S.C. § 1715z-20), relating to insurance on home equity conversion mortgages for elderly homeowners.</p>
