                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The Special Assessment levied under this section shall be collected in the Southwest Waterfront Improvement Benefit District each fiscal year beginning with the 1st fiscal year after the issuance of the bonds and continuing until the year specified in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-895.06.html">47-895.06</a> in an amount determined as provided for in this section. A memorandum of the Special Assessment shall be recorded in the land records of the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> There is levied for each fiscal year a Special Assessment upon all real property in the Southwest Waterfront Improvement Benefit District in an amount equal to the Maximum Special Assessment. The Special Assessment shall be an amount equal to the Special Assessment Requirement. The Special Assessment Requirement for any fiscal year shall be estimated by the administrator and determined by the Chief Financial Officer and shall be an amount equal to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The amount required in such fiscal year to pay:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Debt Service and other periodic costs, including deposits to sinking funds, on the bonds;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Any amount required to replenish any reserve fund established in association with the bonds;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Any amount equal to the estimated delinquencies expected in payment of the Special Assessment not otherwise taken into account; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(D)">(D)</span> The costs of remarketing, credit enhancement, bond insurance, and liquidity facility fees, including fees for instruments that serve as the basis of a reserve fund related to any indebtedness in lieu of cash; less</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The Special Assessment Credit equal to the sum of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)">(A)</span> TIF Revenues and PILOT Revenues available to apply to the Special Assessment Requirement for that fiscal year;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Any credits available pursuant to the Indenture of Trust, such as capitalized interest, reserves, and investment earnings on any account balances; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Any other revenues available to apply to the Special Assessment Requirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Commencing with the fiscal year in which bonds are first issued and for each following fiscal year, the District shall determine the Special Assessment Requirement, if any, as provided in subsection (b) of this section for the fiscal year and shall collect the Special Assessment proportionately from each lot in arrears in an amount up to the Adjusted Maximum Special Assessment from each lot such that the total of the Special Assessment to be collected shall equal the Special Assessment Requirement. The administrator shall provide an estimate to the Chief Financial Officer each fiscal year of the Special Assessment to be collected from each lot in conformance with the provisions of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The Maximum Special Assessment shall be established by the Chief Financial Officer at the time the bonds are issued to reflect the rate of interest on the bonds, and the amount of the bonds issued, in an amount that provides for adequate Special Assessment revenue to pay Debt Service and any other expected amounts of the Special Assessment Requirement as provided in the Indenture of Trust. The Maximum Special Assessment for each lot shall be the Maximum Special Assessment divided by the Equivalent Units of all lots subject to Special Assessment multiplied by the Equivalent Unit of each lot, which may be calculated separately for each phase and the bonds issued with respect to each phase. The Adjusted Maximum Special Assessment for the lot shall be equal to the Maximum Special Assessment for the lot less the Special Assessment Credit for the lot. The Special Assessment Credit applied to all lots shall not exceed the TIF Revenues and the PILOT Revenues taken into account in determining the Special Assessment Requirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The Special Assessment to be collected from any lot may be increased as a result of a default in the payment of the Special Assessment levied on any other lot only in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Special Assessment to be collected from any lot shall not be increased above the Adjusted Maximum Special Assessment as a result of a default in the payment of the Special Assessment levied on any other lot. If the Special Assessment to be collected from any lot is less than the Adjusted Maximum Special Assessment for such lot, the Special Assessment may be increased up to the Adjusted Maximum Special Assessment as a result of the default in the payment of the Special Assessment levied on any other lot.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The Special Assessment shall be an assessment for purposes of §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-832.html">47-832</a> through <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-835.html">47-835</a> relating to subdivision of lots, parcels, or tracts.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The Master Developer shall consent to the levy of the Special Assessment on the lots, following which consent all actions by any owner of a lot to challenge the levy of the Special Assessment, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be forever barred. The Master Developer and any subsequent owner of a lot shall provide notice to the buyer of the lot of the levy of the Special Assessment and any contract for the sale of the lot may be voided without penalty by the buyer prior to purchase of the lot if the buyer does not receive notice of the Special Assessment from the Master Developer or the subsequent owner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The owner of a lot subject to Special Assessment under this subchapter may contest the amount of the Special Assessment, but not the authority to levy the Special Assessment, by filing a written notice of appeal of the amount with the Chief Financial Officer not later than 180 days after the due date of the payment of the Special Assessment. The Chief Financial Officer, or the administrator if designated by the Chief Financial Officer to hear the appeal, shall promptly review the appeal and, if necessary, meet with the owner of the lot, consider written and oral evidence regarding the amount of the Special Assessment, and decide the appeal. If the result of the appeal requires the Special Assessment to be modified or changed in favor of the owner of the lot, a cash refund shall not be made (except in the last year of the levy), but an adjustment shall be made to the next Special Assessment to be collected from that lot. No interest on the adjustment shall be due to the owner of the lot. A decision of the administrator may be appealed to the Chief Financial Officer. This procedure shall be exclusive and its exhaustion by any owner of a lot shall be a condition precedent to any other appeal or legal action by the owner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If the Chief Financial Officer learns that a lot subject to the Special Assessment has been omitted from the Special Assessment for any previous tax year or tax years, the Chief Financial Officer shall provide notice to the owner and shall collect the Special Assessment amount in arrears, including penalty and interest, from the date the Special Assessment should have been paid; provided, that no lot that has not been billed for the Special Assessment shall be liable under this section for a period of more than 3 prior tax years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Special Assessments shall be collected each year for the preceding fiscal year in the same manner and at the same time as real property taxes are collected.</p>

A lien for an unpaid Special Assessment, including penalty and interest, shall attach to the real property in the same manner as, and with a priority immediately junior to, a lien for delinquent real property tax under Chapter 13A of this title and senior to all other liens. Property sold at a tax sale for the failure to pay real property taxes shall remain subject to the obligation to pay Special Assessments in subsequent years as provided in this subchapter. The unpaid Special Assessment shall be collected in the same manner and under the same conditions and subject to the same penalty as for unpaid real property taxes. A Special Assessment shall not be required to be certified for the purposes of Chapter 13A of this title.</p>
