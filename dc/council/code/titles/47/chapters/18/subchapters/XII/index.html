                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/15-217.html">D.C. Law 15-217</a> deleted the first two sentences and inserted “Assessments of any deficiencies in the tax due under this chapter, or any interest and penalties thereon, shall be governed by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-4312.html">47-4312</a>”. in their place. Prior to amendment, the first two sentences had read as follows: “If a deficiency in tax is determined by the Mayor, the taxpayer shall be notified thereof and given a period of not less than 30 days, after such notice is sent by registered mail or by certified mail, in which to file a protest and show cause or reason why the deficiency should not be paid. Opportunity for hearing shall be granted by the Mayor, and a final decision thereon shall be made as quickly as practicable.”</p>

                <p>For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 3(b) of Office of Administrative Hearings Establishment Emergency Amendment Act of 2004 (D.C. Act 15-513, August 2, 2004,  51 DCR 8976).</p>

                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Notice of deficiency is different from an assessment: This section obviously contemplates that an assessment is to be made after the notice of deficiency has been issued, after the taxpayer has filed a protest, and after any hearing has been held.</p>

After such foreign corporation or unincorporated business shall have filed all returns required under this subchapter, and the same shall have been audited, the Mayor shall refund any overpayment to the taxpayer.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days, including Sundays and holidays, equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1st of such year, whichever is the later.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> In determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this section, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia may, by regulations, authorize employers:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> To deduct and withhold upon any payment of wages to such employee during such quarter such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount actually deducted and withheld upon the wages of such employee during such quarter to the amount that would be required to be deducted and withheld during such quarter if the payroll period of the employee were quarterly.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia is authorized to provide by regulation, under such conditions and to such extent as it deems proper, for withholding in addition to that otherwise required under this section in cases in which the employer and the employee agree to such additional withholding.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The manner of withholding and the amount to be deducted and withheld under this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Council of the District of Columbia under which the withholding exemption allowed to the employee in any calendar year shall approximate the withholding exemption allowable with respect to an annual payroll period.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An employee receiving wages shall on any day be entitled to the withholding exemptions allowed under this chapter, unless the Mayor determines that an alternative withholding method is warranted under paragraphs (9) or (11) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Every employee shall, on or before October 1, 1956, or before the date of commencement of employment, whichever is later, furnish his employer with a signed withholding exemption certificate relating to the withholding exemptions which he claims, which in no event shall exceed the number to which he is entitled.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Withholding exemption certificates shall take effect as of the beginning of the first payroll period ending, or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period, on or after the date on which such certificate is so furnished; provided, that certificates furnished before October 1, 1956, shall be considered as furnished on that date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A withholding exemption certificate which takes effect under this section shall continue in effect with respect to the employer until another such certificate takes effect under this section. If a withholding exemption certificate is furnished to take the place of an existing certificate, the employer, at his option, may continue the old certificate in force with respect to all wages paid on or before the first status determination date, January 1st or July 1st of each year, which occurs at least 30 days after the date on which such new certificate is furnished.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> If, on any day during the calendar year, the withholding exemptions to which the employee may reasonably be expected to be entitled at the beginning of his next taxable year is different from the exemptions to which the employee is entitled on such day, the employee shall in such cases and at such times as the Mayor may prescribe, furnish the employer with a withholding exemption certificate relating to the exemptions which he claims with respect to such next taxable year, which shall in no event exceed the exemptions to which he may reasonably be expected to be so entitled. Exemption certificates issued pursuant to this subsection shall not take effect with respect to any payment of wages made in the calendar year in which the certificate is furnished.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> If, on any day during the calendar year, the withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the withholding exemptions claimed by the employee on the withholding exemption certificate then in effect with respect to him, the employee shall, within 10 days thereafter, furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the exemptions to which he is entitled on such day. If, on any day during the calendar year, the withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is greater than the withholding exemptions claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the exemptions to which he is entitled on such day.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Withholding exemption certificates shall be in such form and contain such information as the Council of the District of Columbia may by regulations prescribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> For periods beginning after December 31, 2011, an employee shall be entitled to additional withholding exemptions under this subsection with respect to payment of wages equal to a number determined by dividing by $1,370 his or her estimated itemized deductions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> An employer shall base withholding for the employee on zero withholding exemptions if the Mayor notifies an employer that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> An employee has an unpaid tax liability;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> An employee failed to file a required District of Columbia income tax return; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> An employee is subject to a tax refund interception request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> If the conditions of paragraphs (9)(A), (B), and (C) of this subsection no longer apply, the employer may apply to the Mayor to authorize an increase in the number of withholding exemptions. Upon approval, the Mayor may authorize an increase in the number of withholding exemptions to the level at which they would not have resulted in an underpayment of taxpayer’s most recent income tax return.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> An exemption certificate shall be valid if it states:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The denominator of which equals the amount allowed for each exemption under this chapter for the applicable tax year.</p>

If the employer fails to withhold, the lien shall accrue on the date the amounts were required to be withheld. The liens referred to in this paragraph shall constitute a preferred claim, having priority over all other liens or security interests of whatever kind and however created. If property of an employer is seized under distraint provisions, neither the United States Marshal, nor a receiver, assignee or any other officer shall sell the property without first determining from the Mayor the amounts due and payable by said employer, and if there be any amounts due, owing or unpaid, it shall be the duty of such officer to first pay to the Mayor the said amounts out of the proceeds of such sale before making any payment to any judgment creditor or other claimants of whatsoever kind or nature.</p>
