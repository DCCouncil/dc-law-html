                <p>For the purposes of this subchapter, estates and trusts are: (1) Resident estates or trusts, or (2) nonresident estates or trusts. If the decedent was at the time of his death domiciled within the District, his estate is a resident estate, and any trust created by his will is a resident trust. If the decedent was not at the time of his death domiciled within the District, his estate is a nonresident estate, and any trust created by his will is a nonresident trust. If the creator of a trust was at the time the trust was created domiciled within the District, or if the trust consists of property of a person domiciled within the District, the trust is a resident trust. If the creator of the trust was not at the time the trust was created domiciled within the District, the trust is a nonresident trust. If the trust resulted from the dissolution of a corporation organized under the laws of the District of Columbia the trust is a resident trust. If the trust resulted from the dissolution of a foreign corporation, the trust is a nonresident trust.</p>

                <p>Section 302(d) of D.C. Law 19-226 amended this section to read as follows:</p>
                <p>“§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1810.05.html">47-1810.05</a>. Determination of the business income of the combined group.</p>
                <p>“(a) The business income of a combined group is determined as follows:</p>
                <p>“(1) From the total income of the combined group as determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, subtract any income and add any expense or loss, other than the business income, expense, or loss of the combined group.</p>
                <p>“(2) Except as otherwise provided, the total income of the combined group is the sum of the income of each member of the combined group determined under federal income tax laws, as adjusted for District purposes, as if the member were not consolidated for federal purposes.</p>
                <p>“(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or the combined reporting regulations, if the combined group includes or any member owns an unincorporated business that would be subject to the tax imposed under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1808.03.html">47-1808.03</a>, the income or loss of such unincorporated business shall be apportioned to the District using the apportionment factor of the unincorporated business, and the combined group member- partner’s distributive share of such income shall be added to the combined group member- partner’s income. A combined group member-partner’s distributive share of an unincorporated business’s income that was actually taxed under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1808.03.html">47-1808.03</a> shall be subtracted from the combined group member-partner’s income.</p>
                <p>“(b) The income of each member of the combined group shall be determined as follows:</p>
                <p>“(1) For any member incorporated in the United States, or included in a consolidated federal corporate income tax return, the income to be included in the total income of the combined group shall be the taxable income for the corporation after making appropriate adjustments under this chapter.</p>
                <p>“(2) For any member not included in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the income to be included in the total income of the combined group shall be determined as follows:</p>
                <p>“(A) A profit and loss statement shall be prepared for each foreign branch or corporation in the currency in which the books of account of the branch or corporation are regularly maintained.</p>
                <p>“(B) Adjustments shall be made to the profit and loss statement to conform it to the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for the preparation of such statements, except as modified by regulation.</p>
                <p>“(C) Adjustments shall be made to the profit and loss statement to conform it to the tax accounting standards required by this chapter.</p>
                <p>“(D) Except as otherwise provided by regulation, the profit and loss statement of each member of the combined group, and the apportionment factors related thereto, whether United States or foreign, shall be translated into the currency in which the parent company maintains its books and records.</p>
                <p>“(E) Income apportioned to the District shall be expressed in United States dollars.</p>
                <p>“(3)(A) In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and subject to the determination of the Chief Financial Officer that it reasonably approximates income as determined under this chapter, any member not subject to paragraph (1) of this subsection may determine its income on the basis of the consolidated profit and loss statement that includes the member and that is prepared for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by related corporations.</p>
                <p>“(B) If the member is not required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Chief Financial Officer may allow the use of the consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for reporting to shareholders and subject to review by an independent auditor.</p>
                <p>“(C) If the statements described in subparagraphs (A) or (B) of this paragraph do not reasonably approximate income as determined under this chapter, the Chief Financial Officer may accept those statements with appropriate adjustments to approximate that income.</p>
                <p>“(4) If a unitary business includes income from a partnership, the income to be included in the total income of the combined group shall be the member of the combined group’s direct and indirect distributive share of the partnership’s unitary business income.</p>
                <p>“(5)(A) All dividends paid by one to another of the members of the combined group shall, to the extent those dividends are paid out of the earnings and profits of the unitary business included in the combined report, in the current or an earlier year, be eliminated from the income of the recipient.</p>
                <p>“(B) Except as otherwise provided, this paragraph shall not apply to dividends received from members of the unitary business that are not a part of the combined group. Except when specifically required by the Chief Financial Officer to be included, all dividends paid by an insurance company directly or indirectly to a corporation that is part of a unitary business with the insurance company shall be deducted or eliminated from the income of the recipient of the dividend.</p>
                <p>“(6)(A) Except as otherwise provided by regulation, business income from an inter-company transaction between members of the same combined group shall be deferred in a manner similar to  26 C.F.R. § 1.1502-13.</p>
                <p>“(B) Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, deferred business income resulting from an inter-company transaction between members of a combined group shall be restored to the income of the seller and shall be apportioned as business income earned immediately before the event:</p>
                <p>“(i) The object of a deferred inter-company transaction is:</p>
                <p>“(I) Resold by the buyer to an entity that is not a member of the combined group;</p>
                <p>“(II) Resold by the buyer to an entity that is a member of the combined group for use outside the unitary business in which the buyer and seller are engaged; or</p>
                <p>“(III) Converted by the buyer to a use outside the unitary business in which the buyer and seller are engaged; or</p>
                <p>“(ii) The buyer and seller are no longer members of the same combined group, regardless of whether the members remain unitary.</p>
                <p>“(7)(A) A charitable expense incurred by a member of a combined group shall, to the extent allowable as a deduction pursuant to  section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, be subtracted first from the business income of the combined group, subject to the income limitations of that section applied to the entire business income of the group, and any remaining amount shall then be treated as a nonbusiness expense allocable to the member that incurred the expense, subject to the income limitations of that section applied to the nonbusiness income of that specific member.</p>
                <p>“(B) Any charitable deduction disallowed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, but allowed as a carryover deduction in a subsequent year, shall be treated as originally incurred in the subsequent year by the same member, and the rules set forth in this section shall apply in the subsequent year in determining the allowable deduction in that year.</p>
                <p>“(8) Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of capital assets, property described by  section 1231(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and property subject to an involuntary conversion shall be removed from the total separate net income of each member of a combined group and shall be apportioned and allocated as follows:</p>
                <p>“(A) For each class of gain or loss (short-term capital, long-term capital,  section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and involuntary conversions) all members’ business gain and loss for the class shall be combined without netting between classes and each class of net business gain or loss separately apportioned to each member using the member’s apportionment percentage determined under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1810.04.html">47-1810.04</a>.</p>
                <p>“(B) Each taxpayer member shall then net its apportioned business gain or loss for all classes, including any such apportioned business gain and loss from other combined groups, against the taxpayer member’s nonbusiness gain and loss for all classes allocated to the District, using the rules of  sections 1222 and  1231 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, without regard to any of the taxpayer member’s gains or losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets,  section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 property, and involuntary conversions that are nonbusiness items allocated to another state.</p>
                <p>“(C) Any resulting District source income or loss, if the loss is not subject to the limitations of  section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, of a taxpayer member produced by the application of the preceding subparagraphs shall then be applied to all other District source income or loss of that member.</p>
                <p>“(D) Any resulting District source loss of a member that is subject to the limitations of  section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be carried over by that member and shall be treated as District source short-term capital loss incurred by that member for the year for which the carryover applies.</p>
                <p>“(9) Any expense of one member of the unitary group that is directly or indirectly attributable to the nonbusiness or exempt income of another member of the unitary group shall be allocated to that other member as a corresponding nonbusiness or exempt expense, as appropriate.”</p>

                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/15-217.html">D.C. Law 15-217</a> deleted the first two sentences and inserted “Assessments of any deficiencies in the tax due under this chapter, or any interest and penalties thereon, shall be governed by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-4312.html">47-4312</a>”. in their place. Prior to amendment, the first two sentences had read as follows: “If a deficiency in tax is determined by the Mayor, the taxpayer shall be notified thereof and given a period of not less than 30 days, after such notice is sent by registered mail or by certified mail, in which to file a protest and show cause or reason why the deficiency should not be paid. Opportunity for hearing shall be granted by the Mayor, and a final decision thereon shall be made as quickly as practicable.”</p>

                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Notice of deficiency is different from an assessment: This section obviously contemplates that an assessment is to be made after the notice of deficiency has been issued, after the taxpayer has filed a protest, and after any hearing has been held.</p>

                <p>“(a) Declaration and payment.—Every corporation, financial institution, and unincorporated business required to make and file a franchise tax return under this chapter shall make and file a declaration of estimated tax at such time or times and under such conditions, and shall make payments of such tax during its taxable year in such amounts and under such conditions, as the Mayor of the District of Columbia shall by regulations prescribe. In the case of the taxable year beginning in 1970, such regulations may not require payment before the last day on which a return for such taxable year is required to be filed under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1805.03.html">47-1805.03</a>(a) of an aggregate amount of estimated tax for such year in excess of one-half of such estimated tax; provided, however, that in the case of financial institutions, the provisions of this section shall be subject to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2507.html">47-2507</a>(a)(3) and to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2507.html">47-2507</a>(b)(3).</p>
                <p>“(b) Underpayment. —</p>
                <p>“(1)(A) Addition to tax.—In case of any underpayment of estimated tax by a corporation, financial institution, or an unincorporated business, there shall be added to the tax for the taxable year an amount determined at the rate of 1 and 1/2% per month upon the amount of the underpayment (determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) for the period of the underpayment (determined under subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this paragraph).</p>
                <p>“(B) Amount of underpayment.—For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of:</p>
                <p>“(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of:</p>
                <p>“(I) The amount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to 90% of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or, if no return was filed, 90% of the tax for such year; over</p>

                <p>“(C) Period of underpayment.—(i)The period of the underpayment shall run from the date the installment was required to be paid to whichever of the following dates is the earlier:</p>
                <p>“(I) The 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the taxable year; or</p>
                <p>“(II) With respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which such portion is paid.</p>
                <p>“(ii) Every financial institution required to file a gross earnings tax return and a franchise tax return for the 3-year transition period described in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2507.html">47-2507</a>(b)(2) shall calculate the amount of underpayment for each such taxable year in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2507.html">47-2507</a>(b)(3)(B).</p>
                <p>“(2) For purposes of subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a payment of estimated tax on any installment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the extent such payment exceeds the amount of the installment determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i) of this subsection for such installment date.</p>
                <p>“(c) Overpayment.—Overpayment resulting from the payment of estimated tax for a taxable year in excess of the amount determined to be due upon the filing of a franchise tax return for such taxable year may be credited against the amount of estimated tax determined to be due on any declaration filed for the next succeeding taxable year or for any deficiency or nonpayment of tax for any previous taxable year. No refund shall be made of any estimated tax paid unless a complete return is filed.”</p>
