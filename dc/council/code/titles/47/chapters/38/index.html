                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/13-166.html">D.C. Law 13-166</a> rewrote this section, which previously read:</p>
                <p>“For the purposes of this chapter, the term:</p>
                <p>“(1) ‘Fair market rent’ means an amount as determined by the Mayor with reference to the average rent charged to tenants for occupancy of comparable space in other buildings in the underserved area.</p>
                <p>“(2)(A) ‘Supermarket’ means a self-service retail establishment, independently owned or part of a corporation operating a chain of supermarkets under the same name, that:</p>
                <p>“(i) Is licensed as a grocery store pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2827.html">47-2827</a>;</p>

                <p>“(iii) Occupies at least 6,000 square feet of space.</p>
                <p>“(B) The term ‘supermarket’ shall include related service departments, such as kitchens, bakeries, pharmacies, or flower shops of a retail establishment that meet the criteria set by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
                <p>“(3) ‘Supermarket development’ means a new supermarket for which construction begins on or after September 29, 1988, or an expansion or modernization of an existing supermarket if the expansion or modernization begins on or after September 29, 1988.</p>
                <p>“(4) ‘Underserved area’ means an area of no more than one square mile within the District having a ratio of less than 2 supermarkets per 10,000 residents or having less than 1 supermarket.”</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/17-138.html">D.C. Law 17-138</a> designated the existing text of par. (1) as subpar. (A); added pars. (1)(B), (1A), (1B); and, in par. (2), deleted “as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-1219.20.html">2-1219.20</a>” following “area”.</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/18-353.html">D.C. Law 18-353</a>, in pars. (1B) and (2), substituted “eligible area” for “priority development area”; and added pars. (1C) and (1D).</p>
                <p>The 2012 amendment by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-171.html">D.C. Law 19-171</a> substituted “an eligible” for “a eligible” in (1B) and (2).</p>
                <h4>Cross References</h4>
                <p>License law, supermarket developments, exemption conditions, see § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2827.html">47-2827</a>.</p>
                <p>Real property exempt from taxation, enumerated, see § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1002.html">47-1002</a>.</p>
                <h4>Applicability</h4>
                <p>Applicability of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-204.html">D.C. Law 21-204</a>: <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-204.html#§4">§ 4 of D.C.

Law 21-204</a> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore that amendment has not been given effect.</p>
