                <p>The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Homeownership can be afforded by very few lower income families in the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Homeownership stabilizes families and, in turn, stabilizes neighborhoods, contributing to improved housing conditions and safer, better quality neighborhoods.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The District of Columbia government budgets for the fiscal years ending September 30, 1983, and September 30, 1984, do not have funds available for significant new homeownership initiatives.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Homeownership for lower income families can be achieved, on a limited basis, through the work of nonprofit housing organizations and through private investments in shared equity arrangements which are encouraged by existing federal and District of Columbia income tax laws.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Additional support for nonprofit housing organizations, and private investors in shared equity arrangements, through property tax abatements and other incentives can serve to expand homeownership for lower income families at little or no additional cost to the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Expansion of homeownership opportunities for lower income families is beneficial to the public peace, health, safety and general welfare.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The purpose of this act is to expand homeownership opportunities for lower income families to the maximum extent possible at the lowest possible direct cost to the District of Columbia.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Receive, pursuant to a shared equity financing agreement which complies with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. § 280A(d)(3), at least a 5% qualified ownership interest, the right to occupy the unit, and an option to purchase the remaining ownership interest at a specified later date.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The household income does not exceed 110% of the area median income guidelines established pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-2604.html">42-2604</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> This chapter shall not apply if the fair market value of the unit or residential property exceeds 80% of the median sale price for homes within the District of Columbia in the prior year as of the date that the application for exemption is filed, unless the unit or residential property is a for-sale unit constructed pursuant to [subchapter I of Chapter 28 of Title 42 (§  42-2801 et seq.)] that remains affordable for 180 months or a longer period selected by the developer, in accordance with section 2218 of Title 14 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (14 DCMR § 2218), then this chapter shall apply.</p>
