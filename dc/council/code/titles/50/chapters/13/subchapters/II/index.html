                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>

Service of such process shall be made by leaving a copy of the process with a fee of $2 in the hands of the Mayor or in his office, and such service shall be sufficient service upon the said nonresident; provided, that notice of such service and a copy of the summons and complaint are forthwith sent by certified mail without return receipt requested by the plaintiff, or his attorney, to the defendant at his last known address. The plaintiff has a duty to exercise due diligence in the investigation of the last known address of the defendant. The court in which the action is pending may order such continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant a reasonable opportunity to defend the action, and no judgment by default in any such action shall be granted until at least 20 days shall have elapsed after attempted service upon the defendant, as hereinabove provided, of a copy of the process and notice of service of said process upon the Mayor.</p>

Where a nonresident has been served in accordance with this section and he dies thereafter, the court must allow the action to be continued against his executor, administrator, or other personal representative upon motion, and with such notice as the court deems proper. Except as otherwise provided in the 2 preceding sentences, service of process may be made on the executor, administrator, or other personal representative of a nonresident in the same manner as is provided in this section in the case of a nonresident.</p>
