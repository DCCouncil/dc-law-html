The Mayor may compile notices of infraction for parking violations and for violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system or an automated parking enforcement system, issued during a 30-day period, reconcile traffic records, and generate a consolidated monthly fleet infraction report for motor vehicle fleet owners who have registered those motor vehicles comprising a fleet.
