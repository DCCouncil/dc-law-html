A duplicate of each notice of infraction shall be served on the person to whom it is issued as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Mayor is authorized to implement a fleet reconciliation program. The Mayor may compile notices of infraction for parking violations and for violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system or an automated parking enforcement system, issued during a 30-day period, reconcile traffic records, and generate a consolidated monthly fleet infraction report for motor vehicle fleet owners who have registered those motor vehicles comprising a fleet. The monthly fleet infraction report shall serve as the summons and complaint.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor may, by rulemaking, impose a registration fee on all motor vehicle fleet owners authorized to participate in this program. The registration fee shall recover the administrative costs associated with the administration and enforcement of this chapter with respect to fleets.</p>
