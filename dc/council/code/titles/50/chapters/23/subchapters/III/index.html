                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The notice of infraction shall be the summons and complaint for the purposes of this subchapter. The Director shall prescribe the form of the notice of infraction and shall establish procedures for the proper administrative controls over the dispersal thereof. The notice of infraction may be the same as the uniform traffic violation notice.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The notice of infraction shall contain information advising the person to whom it is issued of the manner in which and the time within which he may answer to the infraction alleged in the notice. Such notice shall also contain a warning to advise the person cited that failure to answer in the manner and time provided shall result in additional monetary penalties and that failure to appear at the hearing shall be deemed an admission of liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon. A duplicate of each notice of infraction shall be served on the person to whom it is issued as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The original or a facsimile thereof shall be filed with the Department and retained by the Department and shall be deemed a record kept in the ordinary course of business and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Except as provided in subsection (c-1) of this section, a notice of infraction shall be served personally upon the operator of a vehicle who is present at the time of service or by affixing the notice to the vehicle in a conspicuous place and by noting the plate designation and plate type as shown by the registration plates of the vehicle together with the make or model of the vehicle.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c-1)</span> When a violation is detected by an automated parking enforcement system, the Mayor shall mail a notice of infraction to the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles or the appropriate state motor vehicle agency. The notice shall include:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The date, time, and location of the violation;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The type of violation detected;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The license plate number and state of license plate issuance of the vehicle detected; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A copy of the photo or digitized image of the violation.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c-2)</span> Service of the notice of infraction, or a duplicate, by affixation or by mail shall have the same force and effect and shall be subject to the same penalties for the disregard thereof as though the notice of infraction was personally served on the owner and operator of the vehicle.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> For purposes of this section, an operator of a vehicle who is not the owner thereof but who uses or operates such vehicle with the permission of the owner, express or implied, shall be deemed to be the agent of such owner to receive notices of infraction, whether personally served on such operator or served by affixation, and service made in either manner shall also be deemed to be lawful service upon such owner.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If a hearing examiner determines that a notice of infraction is defective on its face, for reasons other than compliance with subsection (b) of this section, he shall enter an order dismissing the notice of infraction and promptly notify the person to whom it was issued.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> For the purposes of this section, the term:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> “Fleet” means 10 or more company owned or long-term leased motor vehicles, or a vehicle that was part of the fleet adjudication program, which the motor vehicle owner elects to be part of the fleet reconciliation program.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> “Motor vehicle fleet owner” means any corporation, firm, agency, association, organization, or other entity holding legal title to 10 or more company owned or leased motor vehicles and an owner who was part of the fleet adjudication program and elects to be part of the fleet reconciliation program.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Mayor is authorized to implement a fleet reconciliation program. The Mayor may compile notices of infraction for parking violations and for violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system or an automated parking enforcement system, issued during a 30-day period, reconcile traffic records, and generate a consolidated monthly fleet infraction report for motor vehicle fleet owners who have registered those motor vehicles comprising a fleet. The monthly fleet infraction report shall serve as the summons and complaint.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor may, by rulemaking, impose a registration fee on all motor vehicle fleet owners authorized to participate in this program. The registration fee shall recover the administrative costs associated with the administration and enforcement of this chapter with respect to fleets.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> To participate in the fleet reconciliation program, a motor vehicle fleet owner shall:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Register its fleet with the Department of Motor Vehicles;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Pay a registration fee to cover the District government’s administrative costs for the fleet reconciliation program; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Satisfy all outstanding parking, moving, and automatic enforcement infractions prior to registration in the program.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> A fleet owner participating in the fleet reconciliation program shall pay the amount owed stated in the monthly fleet infraction report, which sets forth the date and time of the infraction and other information contained in the original notice of infraction, within 30 days of its receipt. If the amount set forth in the fleet infraction report is not paid within 30 days, the Director shall notify the owner in writing that failure to pay within 30 days of the date of the notice of failure to pay shall be grounds for removal from the program. A fleet owner shall be given notice in writing if it is being removed from the program. The effective date of the removal shall be the date that notice of removal is sent to the fleet owner. A fleet owner shall not be entitled to adjudicate any violations listed in the monthly fleet infraction report. Penalties set forth in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-2301.05.html">50-2301.05</a>(a)(2) are not applicable to the fleet reconciliation program. If a fleet owner is removed from the program by the Director, then the penalties set forth in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-2301.05.html">50-2301.05</a>(a)(2) shall immediately apply and the owner shall be responsible for any penalties that would have incurred if the vehicle had not been part of the program. A fleet vehicle shall not be subject to towing or immobilization, for failure to pay notices of infraction while part of the fleet reconciliation program. If a fleet vehicle is removed from the program, either voluntarily or as a result of removal by the Director, the vehicle shall become immediately subject to towing or immobilization if the vehicle would have been subject to towing or immobilization had it not been part of the program.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e-1)</span> Notwithstanding the provisions of the Driver Education Program and Fleet Program Amendment Act of 2009 [subtitle A of title VI of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/18-111.html">D.C.
