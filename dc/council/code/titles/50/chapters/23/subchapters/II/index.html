The judgment and suspension shall take effect and notice shall be given in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-2302.05.html">50-2302.05</a>(f).

The police officer issuing the notice of infraction shall not be required to attend the hearing of a case wherein the respondent has admitted or has admitted with explanation the commission of the infraction unless:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> The respondent requests the presence of the officer at the same time that he answers to the infraction and the hearing examiner determines that the testimony of such officer would assist his determination of the appropriate sanction to impose; or</p>

If a respondent surrenders his operator’s permit, a temporary permit shall be issued pursuant to the standards set forth in § 9.202(b)(2) of Title 32 of the District of Columbia Rules and Regulations.</p>
