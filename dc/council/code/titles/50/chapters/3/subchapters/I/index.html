              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>The Council of the District of Columbia (“Council”) finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Passenger transportation by public vehicles-for-hire, particularly by taxicabs, is an integral and important component of public transit within the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> The business of transporting passengers and baggage for hire by taxicab is an important public interest requiring governmental supervision, regulation, and control.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> The taxicab industry in the District has been and is currently marked by an absence of modern vehicles, quality service, and innovative technology.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> Considering the importance of the taxicab industry to the overall public transportation system within the District, there should be established a means of funding and regulation for the furtherance of coherent, efficient, and enforceable regulation, and for the establishment of sound taxicab transportation policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> Recommendations have been made over the course of several decades by various private and commissioned studies, task forces, public and private groups, individuals, and Congressional committees and subcommittees urging regulatory and operational reform of the taxicab industry.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> Based upon the consistency of recommendations made over the years relating to regulatory reform of the system of taxi supervision, and based upon the Council’s own evaluation of the present structure of governmental regulation, the Council finds that improved regulatory, educational, and enforcement performance is in the public interest.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(7)">(7)</span> The taxicab industry within the District is largely comprised of thousands of individual licensees conducting business on a self-employment basis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(8)">(8)</span> In view of these findings, the Council believes that the citizens of the District will benefit from the enactment of the Taxicab Service Improvement Amendment Act of 2012, effective October 22, 2013 (<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-184.html">D.C.

The Commissioner shall periodically review all blanket bonds or blanket policies filed under this subsection to assure that the amount of the bond or policy is adequate to protect the public and may after a hearing order the adjustment of the required amount of the bond or policy as is reasonable and necessary to protect the public; or</p>

A sinking fund shall not be created unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the owner is possessed and will continue to be possessed of the financial ability to pay judgments obtained against the owner. If such a fund has been created, the Commissioner shall have authority and shall periodically require whatever evidence of the owner’s financial status is necessary to satisfy the Commissioner of financial ability to pay judgments, and may, based upon findings after a hearing, impose any reasonable and necessary requirement as will assure the financial integrity of the fund. If upon the evidence and after a hearing on the issue the Commissioner finds that a fund is not possessed and will likely not continue to be possessed of financial ability to pay judgments, the Commissioner shall require that the owner file a bond or policy of insurance required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-301.14.html">50-301.14</a>, and shall return to the owner the amount of the sinking fund when the Commissioner is satisfied that the maintenance thereof is not needed to assure the payment of any claim or judgment then outstanding.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The DFHV shall have one year from October 22, 2012, to modernize the taxicab fleet, and make vehicle and equipment improvements, including:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> A meter system that facilitates non-cash payment of a taxicab fare, including credit cards, debit cards, and other generally acceptable means of purchasing goods and services as defined by the DFHV, prints receipts to passengers automatically, and allows non-cash payment to be made in the rear compartment of the taxicab without handling by the taxicab operator. This system shall contain an authenticated login unique to each individual taxicab operator, and shall electronically collect trip-sheet data through the use of GPS technology. GPS data shall not be collected unless a taxicab operator is currently logged into the meter system. The meter system shall consist of an information monitor for the taxicab operator that is able to send and receive text messages, and shall allow for integration with web, tablet, or cellular phone dispatch applications that can transmit the location of potential passengers to the taxicab operator information monitor. The DFHV may elect to certify the technology that can integrate with the meter system. The system shall also include an information monitor for passengers that, at a minimum, shall provide audio-visual content, including advertising, and is capable of being muted or turned off by the passenger for the duration of the ride;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Uniform cruising lights that clearly display a taxicab’s identification number, as well as identify when a taxicab is occupied, on-call, off-duty, or available to accept a fare; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Uniform color and an emblem symbolizing the flag of the District. The DFHV shall issue rules allowing all vehicles operated by taxicab companies, fleets, and associations to place an insignia or logo on the vehicle, requiring the insignia to be of a certain size and placement on the vehicle. If a taxicab is powered by an alternative fuel, it may display this information on the exterior of the vehicle with a term or symbol approved by the DFHV. Taxicabs licensed to operate in the District as of the date on which the DFHV issues rules to implement this paragraph shall be permitted to maintain their current color scheme. The uniform color and emblem shall apply only to new vehicles entering taxicab service or when owners choose to repaint their existing vehicles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The DFHV may issue rules and regulations regarding the installation or use of counterfeit or non-compliant public vehicle-for-hire equipment or technology systems. Any person who willfully installs or uses any counterfeit or imitation public vehicle-for-hire equipment or technology systems shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be imprisoned no more than 180 days or fined no more than $1,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> The DFHV shall create a notice to be posted in a conspicuous location in all taxicabs in clear view of passengers.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(C)">(C)</span> A statement that failure to accept a credit card is a violation of the law and is punishable by fine; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(D)">(D)</span> The information required for passengers to submit an alleged violation, including a telephone number and website address to the agency responsible for handling the complaint.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> To obtain a copy of the notice required to be posted under this subsection, the owner or operator of a taxicab required to post the notice shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Print the notice from the DFHV website; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Request that the notice be mailed and submit payment to the DFHV for the cost of printing and first-class postage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The DFHV shall post a notice on its website indicating that compliance with this subsection is mandatory as well as the penalties for failure to comply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> A violation of this subsection shall be punishable by a civil fine or other penalty provided by regulation.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The time and location of the event;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Whether the vehicle inspection officer was in a vehicle clearly identifiable by its markings, or if unmarked, was occupied by a vehicle inspection officer in uniform or displaying a badge or other sign of authority;</p>
