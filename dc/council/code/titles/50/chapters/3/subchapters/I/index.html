                <section class="line-group primary-content">
                  <p>The Council of the District of Columbia (“Council”) finds that:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Passenger transportation by public vehicles-for-hire, particularly by taxicabs, is an integral and important component of public transit within the District.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The business of transporting passengers and baggage for hire by taxicab is an important public interest requiring governmental supervision, regulation, and control.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The taxicab industry in the District has been and is currently marked by an absence of modern vehicles, quality service, and innovative technology.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Considering the importance of the taxicab industry to the overall public transportation system within the District, there should be established a means of funding and regulation for the furtherance of coherent, efficient, and enforceable regulation, and for the establishment of sound taxicab transportation policy.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Recommendations have been made over the course of several decades by various private and commissioned studies, task forces, public and private groups, individuals, and Congressional committees and subcommittees urging regulatory and operational reform of the taxicab industry.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Based upon the consistency of recommendations made over the years relating to regulatory reform of the system of taxi supervision, and based upon the Council’s own evaluation of the present structure of governmental regulation, the Council finds that improved regulatory, educational, and enforcement performance is in the public interest.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The taxicab industry within the District is largely comprised of thousands of individual licensees conducting business on a self-employment basis.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> In view of these findings, the Council believes that the citizens of the District will benefit from the enactment of the Taxicab Service Improvement Amendment Act of 2012, effective October 22, 2013 (<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-184.html">D.C. Law 19-184</a>; 59 DCR 9431).</p>

The Commissioner shall periodically review all blanket bonds or blanket policies filed under this subsection to assure that the amount of the bond or policy is adequate to protect the public and may after a hearing order the adjustment of the required amount of the bond or policy as is reasonable and necessary to protect the public; or</p>

A sinking fund shall not be created unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the owner is possessed and will continue to be possessed of the financial ability to pay judgments obtained against the owner. If such a fund has been created, the Commissioner shall have authority and shall periodically require whatever evidence of the owner’s financial status is necessary to satisfy the Commissioner of financial ability to pay judgments, and may, based upon findings after a hearing, impose any reasonable and necessary requirement as will assure the financial integrity of the fund. If upon the evidence and after a hearing on the issue the Commissioner finds that a fund is not possessed and will likely not continue to be possessed of financial ability to pay judgments, the Commissioner shall require that the owner file a bond or policy of insurance required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-301.14.html">50-301.14</a>, and shall return to the owner the amount of the sinking fund when the Commissioner is satisfied that the maintenance thereof is not needed to assure the payment of any claim or judgment then outstanding. Failure to pay any judgment within 30 days after judgment becomes final shall constitute reasonable grounds for finding that the owner is not possessed of financial ability to pay judgments.</p>

If a wheelchair-accessible vehicle cannot be dispatched within 20 minutes, dispatch shall call another company with wheelchair-accessible vehicles to handle the request, and contact the customer with the name and telephone number of the dispatch service for the available wheelchair-accessible taxicab.

If the insurance maintained by a private vehicle-for-hire operator to fulfill the insurance requirements of this section has lapsed or ceased to exist, the private vehicle-for-hire company shall provide the coverage required by this section beginning with the first dollar of a claim.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> That the operator’s personal automobile insurance policy may not provide coverage, including collision physical damage coverage, comprehensive physical damage coverage, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, or medical payments coverage because the operator uses a vehicle in connection with a private vehicle-for-hire company.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> An insurance policy required by this section may be obtained from an insurance company authorized to do business in the District or with a surplus lines insurance company with an AM Best rating of at least A-.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span> Within one year of March 10, 2015, the Mayor shall assess whether the insurance requirements of this section are appropriate to the risk of private vehicle-for-hire services and shall report its findings to the Council.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(m)</span> For the purposes of this section, the term “pre-arranged ride” shall mean a period of time that begins when a private vehicle-for-hire operator accepts a requested ride through digital dispatch, continues while the operator transports the passenger in the operator’s vehicle, and ends when the passenger departs from the vehicle.</p>
