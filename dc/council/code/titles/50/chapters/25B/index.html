                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> There is established a Ward 1 Enhanced Residential Parking Program (“Program”). Any Ward 1 Advisory Neighborhood Commission (“ANC”) may, by resolution of that ANC, vote to include blocks within the ANC in the Program. The Program will consist of the following requirements:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Any block that participates in the residential permit parking in Ward 1 shall have at least 50% of the legal residential parking spaces on that block designated as Zone 1 Permitted Parking Only;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> A visitor parking pass program shall be available to residents similar to the program in Mount Pleasant required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-2537.html">50-2537</a>; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Any resident owning a vehicle registered at an address on a Ward 1 residential block may be granted a Zone 1 residential parking sticker, in accordance with the process developed by the Mayor pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-2552.html">50-2552</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Blocks within a streetscape construction project impact zone, as designated by the Mayor, shall be excluded from the Program until the Mayor declares that all major construction associated with the streetscape has been completed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The Program shall not apply within one block of a ward boundary. Streets within one block of a ward boundary shall instead be designated so that vehicles displaying a valid residential permit for either adjacent ward may park on any such block that was a residential permit parking street before the institution of the Program.</p>
