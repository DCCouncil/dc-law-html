The required notice shall be provided to the named insured at least 30 calendar days before the effective date of cancellation, or, in the case of nonrenewal, 30 calendar days before the end of the policy period. The notice shall contain a statement advising the named insured of his or her right to request, in writing, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice, that the Commissioner review the action of the insurer in cancelling or refusing to renew the policy of the insured.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Proof of mailing of the notice of cancellation, or of intention not to renew, to the named insured by post office receipt secured or certified mail at the address shown in the policy or to the named insured's last known address shall be sufficient proof of notice.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To renew the policy upon tender of payment; provided, that tender is made within 15 calendar days after the date the named insured discovers, or should have discovered, that his or her policy has not been renewed.</p>
