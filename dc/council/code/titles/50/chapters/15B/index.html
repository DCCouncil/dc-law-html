                        <span>“Security interest” means an interest in a vessel that secures payment or performance of an obligation if the interest is created by contract or arises under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-401.html">28:2-401</a>, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-505.html">28:2-505</a>, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-711.html">28:2-711</a>(3), or § 28:2A-508(e). The term includes any interest of a consignor in a vessel in a transaction that is subject to Article 9 of Subtitle I of Title 28. The term does not include the special property interest of a buyer of a vessel on identification of that vessel to a contract for sale under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-501.html">28:2-501</a>, but a buyer also may acquire a security interest by complying with Article 9 of Subtitle I of Title 28. Except as otherwise provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-505.html">28:2-505</a>, the right of a seller or lessor of a vessel under Article 2 or 2A of Subtitle I of Title 28 to retain or acquire possession of the vessel is not a security interest, but a seller or lessor also may acquire a security interest by complying with Article 9 of Subtitle I of Title 28. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of a vessel notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-401.html">28:2-401</a> is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest.
