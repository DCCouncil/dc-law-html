                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Consent to assume the status of a responsible federal official under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.];</p>

Any power granted to the Mayor or any officer, employee, agency, or instrumentality of the District government by any other law may, in addition to the purposes specified therein, be exercised in furtherance of the carrying out of an approved Community Development Program.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor is authorized to issue, amend, and revoke such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The establishment of the sale price shall be submitted to the Council for a 14-day period of review, excluding days of Council recess, beginning on the day that the resolution is transmitted by the Mayor and received by the Chairman of the Council.  To initiate a disapproval of the sale price submitted to the Council, a member of the Council shall, within the 14-day period, file a written notice of disapproval with the Secretary to the Council.  If this notice is given, the Council may consider and take final action to disapprove the resolution within 30 days after the notice has been filed.  If the Council does not adopt a resolution disapproving the established sale price, then the resolution will be deemed approved.</p>
