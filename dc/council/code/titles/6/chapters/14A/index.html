The monthly fines shall accumulate but shall be assessed annually.</p>
                <p>“(4) The fine described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not exceed $3 million; provided, that an annual fine issued pursuant to subsection (f)(3) of this section shall not count toward the $3 million limit.</p>
                <p>“(5) The Mayor may reduce any or all of the fines for good cause.</p>
                <p>“(g) The Mayor may, for good cause, issue time extensions to a project; provided, that the Mayor shall not grant more than 3, one-year extensions.</p>

                <p>“(i) Substantial improvements shall be subject to the requirements of this section; provided, that only square feet included in a substantial improvement project shall be calculated for the purposes of a fine.</p>
                <p>“(j) The financial security option provided in subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section shall become effective upon the issuance of rules by the Mayor.</p>
                <p>“(k) Any payment made to the District for failure to meet the standards required by sections 4 and 7 shall be deposited in the Green Building Fund.</p>
                <p>“(l) For purposes of this section, ’LEED standard for commercial and institutional buildings` means LEED for New Construction, Core &amp; Shell, Schools, or Retail.”.</p>
