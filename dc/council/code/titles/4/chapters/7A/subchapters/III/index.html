                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The family is participating in prevention and diversion services; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The family has no access to other safe housing that complies with paragraph (9) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> For purposes of determining the eligibility of a family in an interim eligibility placement for shelter pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, safe housing, in addition to meeting the definition of “safe housing” set forth in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-751.01.html">4-751.01</a>(32A), shall satisfy the following criteria:</p>
