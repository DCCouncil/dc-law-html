                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Sixty-three percent of the mothers with children 3 to 5 years of age in the District of Columbia are employed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> During the period 1970 and 1980 the percentage of mothers with young  children in the labor force rose, resulting in a greater proportion of pre-school children requiring child care services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Eighty percent of women in the work force are of childbearing age, and 93% of them are expected to become pregnant at some point in their careers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> There is a substantial need to provide adequate child care facilities for District of Columbia (“District”) government employees that are low cost, safe, and convenient to the job site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> District agencies will experience increased productivity and morale, as  well as lower absenteeism and turnover rates, by its staff by strategically  placing child care facilities in the buildings where the parents work.</p>
