The applicant shall be ineligible for IDA unless he or she:</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Alleges less than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Social Security Act, and has applied to SSA for reconsideration or reopening of its disability decision.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> For any month or period of months in which an IDA recipient receives both IDA and SSI, the IDA recipient shall repay to the District of Columbia:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The entire amount of the IDA assistance payments received if the SSI benefits received for the same period equaled or exceeded the IDA payment; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> That portion of the IDA assistance payments equal in amount to the SSI benefits received for the same period if the SSI benefits received were less than the IDA payment.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To make repayment in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, an IDA applicant shall sign an Interim Assistance Reimbursement Authorization which:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Permits the Social Security Administration to send the individual’s past-due SSI benefit payment to the DHS; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Permits DHS to deduct from these payments an amount equal to the IDA benefits provided.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Upon receipt of an IDA recipient’s past-due SSI benefit, DHS shall calculate, in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of the benefit due to DHS as repayment and the amount, if any, due the IDA recipient. DHS shall then provide the IDA recipient with a written explanation of this calculation and shall pay any amount due the IDA recipient, in accordance with section 1631 of the Social Security Act, approved October 30, 1972 (86 Stat. 1475; 42 U.S.C. § 1383(g)) and SSA Interim Assistance regulations, 20 C.F.R. §§ 416.1901 to 416.1922.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Because having a pending SSI application is an eligibility requirement for IDA, if an IDA recipient is determined by the Social Security Administration to meet the disability requirements for purposes of SSI eligibility but withdraws the SSI application prior to payment of past-due SSI benefits, the IDA benefits received by that individual shall be considered an overpayment and that individual shall be liable to the District for repayment of all IDA benefits received.</p>
