            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> A General Assistance for Children program is established to provide the same benefits for a child as the child would receive under TANF if the child’s caretaker could demonstrate a family relationship with the child that is required in the TANF program. The needs of a caretaker shall not be considered when determining of an assistance unit’s GAC benefits. A caretaker of a child receiving GAC shall not be considered a GAC recipient, or a member of the GAC assistance unit, even if the caretaker receives the payment on the child’s behalf.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> In order to be eligible for GAC assistance benefits an applicant must pursue all available federal benefits prior to approval of GAC benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> All provisions of this chapter that apply to determinations of eligibility for and payments of TANF shall apply to determinations of eligibility for and payments of GAC, except that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The income, assets, and resources of the caretaker shall not be considered in determining eligibility of the assistance unit for GAC; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> An assistance unit headed by a minor shall be ineligible to receive GAC.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c-1)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> GAC benefits shall only be provided for a child if the child’s caretaker can produce authorization from the child’s legally responsible relative or a court of competent jurisdiction designating the applicant as the temporary or permanent caretaker for the child, to the extent such authorization is reasonably obtainable by the caretaker. The Mayor shall specify what constitutes a valid authorization, but shall not require as a condition of eligibility that any specific court action is required concerning the care of the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Where authorization from the child’s legally responsible relative is not reasonably obtainable by the caretaker, the caretaker may offer other proof of a custodial relationship between the caretaker and the child. Proof may include, but is not limited to, leases indicating that the child lives with the caretaker, medical records, or school records bearing the caretaker’s signature or affidavits from teachers, social workers, medical staff, or other professionals involved in the family’s life.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Repealed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The earnings of a GAC program child who is a full-time student and who is employed full-time or part-time, or who is a part-time student and who is employed part-time, shall be disregarded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The following amounts shall be disregarded from the gross monthly earnings of a GAC program child who is a part-time student and employed full-time: The first $7.50, mandatory payroll deductions, and the cost of producing income, as determined by rule by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> If the source of income is other than that provided for in subsection (d), (e), or (f) of this section, no more than $7.50 shall be disregarded.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The Mayor shall issue rules to implement this section in accordance with subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2.</p>

              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> In determining the need of families who are applying for or receiving TANF:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Deduct such amount for a work-related expense as the Mayor shall specify through rulemaking. If the individual is self-employed, work expenses directly related to producing the goods or services, and without which the goods or services could not be produced, shall be excluded from the gross earned income total;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Deduct the cost of care of each dependent child, or care of an incapacitated adult living in the same home and receiving TANF or POWER, up to a maximum amount that the Mayor shall specify through rulemaking. The maximum amount deductible for the cost of care of a child may vary depending upon the age of the child;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> For initial applicants, determine whether the monthly income, after disregards allowed under paragraph (1) or (2) of this section, exceeds the standard of assistance. If so, the family is ineligible for assistance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Disregard all of the monthly gross earned income of each child receiving TANF if the child is a full-time student, or is a part-time student provided he is not employed full time. A part-time student must have a school schedule that is equal to at least one half of a full-time curriculum;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4A)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> For individuals otherwise found eligible to receive TANF, disregard from the individual’s earned income a specific dollar amount and/or a percentage of the earned income. The Mayor shall establish, through rulemaking, the amount and/or percentage of earned income to be disregarded, the period of time during which any earned income may be disregarded, and other rules necessary to implement this provision. The rules shall reflect the District’s interests in rewarding work, assisting needy families, and promoting self-sufficiency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> To the extent permitted under federal law, in calculating the eligibility for Medicaid (other than Transitional Medicaid) of a child or a family with minor children, the Mayor shall disregard earned income to the same extent that earned income is disregarded under TANF. In calculating eligibility for Transitional Medicaid, subject to the approval of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Mayor shall disregard income for the first 12 months of Transitional Medicaid pursuant to the provisions established in § 1925(a) of the Social Security Act, approved October 13, 1988 (102 Stat. 2385; 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-6(a)), and shall disregard income for the second 12 months of Transitional Medicaid pursuant to the provisions established in § 1925(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396r-6(b)). Absent approval by HHS, income shall be disregarded pursuant to applicable federal law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Repealed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5A)</span> Disregard any federal earned income tax credit received;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Income earned by any adult member of the assistance unit shall not be disregarded for any month in which the Department determines that such member:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Within 60 days preceding such month, without good cause (as specified in rules established by the Mayor and adopted by the Council), terminated his or her employment, reduced his or her gross earned income, or refused a bona fide offer of employment;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Voluntarily requested assistance be terminated for the sole purpose of evading any time limit placed on the disregarding of earned income that may be established by rule by the Mayor;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Without good cause, failed to file the periodic report required for that period on time; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Failed to inform the Mayor, without good cause, about earnings affecting eligibility as required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.53.html">4-205.53</a>(a) or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.54.html">4-205.54</a>. The penalty for this failure shall be applied until the recipient’s next periodic report is filed and processed by the Mayor;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Repealed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> Beginning on October 1, 2005, disregard up to the first $150 received per month by the assistance unit that represents a current monthly child support obligation or a voluntary child support payment from an absent parent or spouse; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> Disregard any subsidy received under the program established by Chapter 2A of this title.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The income and assets of a parent living in the same household as a dependent child, but not included in the assistance unit because the parent is ineligible for TANF, shall be considered available to the assistance unit to the extent that the income and assets of a deemed parent, as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.22.html">4-205.22</a>, would be considered available to the assistance unit. The income of a stepparent of the dependent child shall be considered available to the assistance unit to the extent required under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.22.html">4-205.22</a>. In the case of a dependent child whose parent is a minor, the income of the minor parent’s own parent or legal guardian living in the same household as the minor parent and the minor parent’s dependent child shall be considered available to the extent required under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.22.html">4-205.22</a>.</p>

The recipient shall inform the Mayor as soon as the recipient becomes aware that a change will occur, rather than waiting to inform the Mayor in the periodic report required under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.54.html">4-205.54</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Each TANF assistance unit whose members have earned income or recent work history and each assistance unit that has income deemed to it from individuals living with the unit who have earned income or a recent work history shall report periodically, as determined by the Mayor, on:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The family’s income, composition, and other circumstances relevant to the amount of the assistance payment during the reporting period specified by the Mayor;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any changes in income, resources, or other relevant circumstances (as defined by the Mayor) affecting continued eligibility which the family expects to occur in the current reporting period or future reporting period; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If appropriate, stepparent’s income and alien sponsor’s income and resources.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span> The periodic reporting form sent by the Mayor to a recipient shall notify the recipient that failure to provide timely, accurate, and complete information may result in grant reduction or termination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Mayor shall establish a consistent time frame for submission of periodic reports and for submission of information concerning any change in earnings affecting eligibility between reports.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> When the Mayor receives a complete report within the required time frame specified by the Mayor, the Mayor shall promptly change or terminate assistance payments, as may be appropriate, on the basis of information contained in the periodic report. Timely and accurate reporting of increases in previously-reported income shall result only in adjustments of future payments without retroactive penalty for overpayment. Timely and accurate reporting of decreases in previously-reported income shall result only in adjustments of future payments without retroactive adjustments for underpayments. Written notices of a change or termination must be adequate, as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.55.html">4-205.55</a>(a)(2), and must be postmarked no later than 15 days before the date that the recipient would receive the changed payment, or would have received payment if assistance had not been terminated. A recipient has 90 days from the date the notice is postmarked to request a fair hearing. The recipient’s assistance shall be paid pending the hearing only if such payment is required under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.59.html">4-205.59</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If the recipient fails to file a report on time, without good cause, or if the report filed is incomplete, the Mayor shall take prompt action to terminate assistance. The Mayor shall mail the recipient written notice if assistance is being terminated as a result of failure to file or complete a report. The notice must be adequate as defined by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.55.html">4-205.55</a>(a)(2). The notice must be postmarked no later than 15 days prior to the date the recipient would have received payment if assistance had not been terminated.

The recipient’s assistance shall be paid pending the hearing only if such payment is required under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.59.html">4-205.59</a>. If the recipient files a completed report that is received by the Mayor on or before the last day of the month in which the notice was postmarked, the Mayor shall accept this late report and shall make a payment based on the information in the report if the information reliably indicates that the recipient is still eligible for TANF. The payment in the next month shall reflect a penalty for late filing, if the Mayor determines the recipient did not have good cause for late filing. As a penalty for late filing, earned income shall not be disregarded in determining TANF eligibility and benefit levels. Payment in the month after receipt of a late report may be delayed. If the recipient is found ineligible for TANF, based on information in the late report, or eligible for an amount less than the prior period’s payment, the Mayor shall promptly send the recipient written notice of the change, suspension, or termination. The written notice must be adequate as defined by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.55.html">4-205.55</a>(a)(2). The recipient shall have 90 days from the date that the notice is postmarked to request a hearing.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If a recipient has earned income, and fails to file a report of that income on time, without good cause, the earned income, child care, and work expenses disregards shall not be allowed for the month that was to be reported on.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The Mayor may require periodic reporting by any TANF recipient, or category of TANF recipients that has earned income or meets criteria, who the Mayor determines, pursuant to rules promulgated by the Mayor, is likely to calculate income eligibility erroneously.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not affect the eligibility for TANF benefits of a child living with a pregnant or parenting teen who, if otherwise eligible, may receive TANF benefits determined without regard to the needs of the ineligible pregnant or parenting teen.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The types of schools that can be attended to meet the school attendance requirements of subsection (a) of this subsection are as follows: a public school, private school, independent school, parochial school, private instruction, or a course of study or home school program meeting the standards established by the Board for granting a high school equivalency diploma.</p>

Such supportive services will be provided as appropriations are available and in accordance with regulations issued by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The determination of a pregnant or a parenting teen’s ineligibility for federally-funded TANF benefits made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be effective for one month for each month that the pregnant or parenting teen fails to meet the school attendance requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The pregnant or parenting teen is the caretaker of a child fewer than 12 weeks old.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The determination of a pregnant or parenting teen’s ineligibility for federally-funded TANF benefits provided by subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if the information about the pregnant or parenting teen’s school attendance is not available or cannot be verified by the school or the approved alternative educational or training program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The pregnant or parenting teen, or his or her parent, caretaker, or legal guardian, shall cooperate in providing information to verify enrollment information or good cause for absence from school. If at least one of these individuals does not cooperate, the pregnant or parenting teen shall be determined ineligible for federally-funded TANF benefits for each month in which one of the individuals does not cooperate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> The Department shall request school attendance information for a pregnant or parenting teen compiled by a school whenever necessary to ascertain school attendance requirements as required by this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The Department shall request information from the pregnant or parenting teen’s school, institution, or educational program about the attendance of a pregnant or parenting teen who is applying for or receiving federally-funded TANF benefits, and shall otherwise implement procedures for monitoring compliance with this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> School attendance records shall be open for inspection at all times to the Department or other persons authorized to enforce this section; provided, that prior written informed consent is given by the parent, caretaker, or legal guardian of a pregnant or parenting teen or by an emancipated pregnant or parenting teen.</p>
