                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The appropriate authority of the sending state may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children are promoted.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> “Child” means a person who, by reason of minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship, or similar control.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> “Placement” means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family, boarding home, or child-care agency or institution, but does not include an institution that cares for the mentally ill, mentally defective, or epileptic, an institution primarily educational in character, or a hospital or other medical facility.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> “Receiving state” means the state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by a public authority, a private person, or an agency, and whether for placement with a state or local public authority or private agency or person.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> “Sending state” means a party state, including the District of Columbia, an officer or employee of the sending state, a subdivision of a party state, an officer, employee, or court of the party state, or a person, corporation, association, charitable agency, or other entity that sends, brings, or causes to be sent or brought a child to another party state.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Prior to sending, bringing, or causing a child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or prior to a possible adoption, the sending state shall furnish the appropriate authority in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The name, date, and place of birth of the child;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The identity and address of the parents or legal guardian;</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The sending state shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters that relate to the custody, supervision, care, treatment, and disposition of the child that it would have had if the child had remained in the sending state, until the child is adopted, reaches the age of majority, becomes self-supporting, or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. The sending state shall continue to have financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained in this compact shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed in the receiving state.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> When the sending state is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state to provide for the performance of any service with respect to the child by the receiving state as agent for the sending state.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in the receiving state for a private charitable agency of the sending state, nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending state without relieving the responsibility set forth in subsection (a) of this article.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"/>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending state; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Institutional care in the receiving state is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A child is placed, sent, or brought into a receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which both the state from which the child is placed and the receiving state are parties, or to any other agreement between the sending and receiving states that has the force of law.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> DHS shall afford an opportunity for an administrative hearing to the parents or legal guardian before placing a child. Subsequent to the hearing, the decision to make a placement upon request of the parent or guardian of the child may be reviewed at a court hearing in the Juvenile Branch of the Family Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The court hearing shall be held within 30 days after a request is made. The decision to place the child in an institution in another party state shall be upheld if the court finds that:</p>
