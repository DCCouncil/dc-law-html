In addition to withholding of earnings or other income, this lien shall be separate from and in addition to any other lien created by or provided for under law.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If a lien has been filed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and a person having notice of the lien possesses nonexempt personal property of the obligor that may be subject to the lien, the property may not be paid over, released, sold, transferred, encumbered, or conveyed unless:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A release of lien is signed by the party who filed the lien; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A court, after notice to the claimant and hearing, has ordered the release of the lien because arrearages do not exist.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The District shall accord full faith and credit to liens described in subsection (b) of this section that arise in another state, if the other state’s IV-D agency, a party to a support action, or other entity seeking to enforce such a lien complies with the procedural rules relating to recording or serving liens that arise in the District, except that judicial notice or hearing prior to enforcement of the lien shall not be required.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span> The IV-D agency shall develop standards for consumer credit reporting that shall be consistent with credit reporting industry standards and reporting format.</p>

The publication may be made by disseminating the information using any media, or by any other means reasonably likely to assist in locating the obligor or to bring the obligor’s non-payment of support to the attention of the public.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Court may direct that an obligor’s commitment may be served upon certain specified days or parts of days.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> For purposes of this section, failure to pay child support, as ordered, shall constitute prima facie evidence of a willful violation.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The Court shall not deny a request for relief pursuant to this section unless the facts and circumstances constituting the reasons for its determination are set forth in a written memorandum of decision.</p>
