                <p>“Sec. 11. Objections to withholding.</p>
                <p>“(a) An obligor may object to a withholding commenced pursuant to section 8a by filing a motion to quash the withholding with the Court within 15 days after the earlier of the date the notice of withholding was mailed or the date the first payment was withheld.</p>
                <p>“(b) The Court shall resolve any motion to quash the withholding within 90 days after service of the motion on the opposing party, unless, upon a showing of good cause, the Court finds that additional time is needed to resolve the motion.</p>
                <p>“(c) The only ground for an objection to a withholding is a mistake of fact, which is defined as:</p>
                <p>“(1) A mistake in the amount of arrears;</p>
                <p>“(2) A mistake in the identity of the obligor; or</p>

                <p>“(d) Payment of arrearages after the date of issuance of a notice of withholding to the obligor pursuant to section 10 is not a defense to the withholding.</p>
                <p>“(e) The Court shall deny the motion in all cases except where the identity of the obligor is mistaken or, if applicable, where arrearages have never equaled one month of support payments, and shall notify the obligor.</p>
                <p>“(f) If the Court determines that the amount to be withheld exceeds the limits of section 9 or section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Court shall serve or direct the IV-D agency to serve an order to withhold on the holder that complies with those limits.</p>
                <p>“(g) The Court shall deny any request to stay the withholding pending resolution of an objection or appeal.”</p>

                <p>“(g) The Court, upon receiving a certified copy of any amendment or modification to a support order entered, shall initiate, as though it was a support order of this jurisdiction, necessary procedures to amend or modify the income withholding order or notice of jurisdiction that was based upon the entered support order.</p>
                <p>“(h) If the Court determines that the obligor has obtained employment or has a new or additional source of income in another jurisdiction, it shall notify the agency that requested the income withholding of the changes within 20 working days of receiving the information and shall forward to that agency all information it has or can obtain with respect to the obligor’s new address and the name and address of the obligor’s new employer or other source of income.
