The term “wrongfully obtains or uses” includes conduct previously known as larceny, larceny by trick, larceny by trust, embezzlement, and false pretenses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A person commits the offense of theft if that person wrongfully obtains or uses the property of another with intent:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To appropriate the property to his or her own use or to the use of a third person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> In cases in which the theft of property is in the form of services, proof that a person obtained services that he or she knew or had reason to believe were available to him or her only for compensation and that he or she departed from the place where the services were obtained knowing or having reason to believe that no payment had been made for the services rendered in circumstances where payment is ordinarily made immediately upon the rendering of the services or prior to departure from the place where the services are obtained, shall be prima facie evidence that the person had committed the offense of theft.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A person commits the offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle under this subsection if, after renting, leasing, or using a motor vehicle under a written agreement which provides for the return of the motor vehicle to a particular place at a specified time, that person knowingly fails to return the motor vehicle to that place (or to any authorized agent of the party from whom the motor vehicle was obtained under the agreement) within 18 days after written demand is made for its return, if the conditions set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection are met.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The conditions referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection are as follows:</p>

This statement shall be printed clearly and conspicuously in a contrasting color, set off in a box, and signed by the person obtaining the motor vehicle in a space specially provided;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> There is displayed clearly and conspicuously on the dashboard of the motor vehicle the following notice: “NOTICE — Failure to return this vehicle on time may result in serious criminal penalties”; and</p>

The written demand shall state clearly that failure to return the motor vehicle may result in prosecution for violation of the criminal law of the District of Columbia punishable by up to 3 years in jail. The written demand shall not be made prior to the date specified in the agreement for the return of the motor vehicle, except that, if the parties or their authorized agents have mutually agreed to some other date for the return of the motor vehicle, then the written demand shall not be made prior to the other date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> This subsection shall not apply in the case of a motor vehicle obtained under a retail installation contract as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-601.html">50-601</a>(9).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> It shall be a defense in any criminal proceeding brought under this subsection that a person failed to return a motor vehicle for causes beyond his or her control. The burden of raising and going forward with the evidence with respect to such a defense shall be on the person asserting it. In any case in which such a defense is raised, evidence that the person obtained the motor vehicle by reason of any false statement or representation of material fact, including a false statement or representation regarding his or her name, residence, employment, or operator’s license, shall be admissible to determine whether the failure to return the motor vehicle was for causes beyond his or her control.</p>
