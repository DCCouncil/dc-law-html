                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> “Actual innocence” or “actually innocent” means that the person did not commit the crime of which he or she was convicted.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> “Biological material” means the contents of a sexual assault examination kit, bodily fluids (including, but not limited to, blood, semen, saliva, and vaginal fluid), hair, skin tissue, fingernail scrapings, bone, or other human DNA source matter which apparently derived from the perpetrator of a crime or, under circumstances that may be probative of the perpetrator’s identity, apparently derived from the victim of a crime. This definition applies equally to material that is present on other evidence, including, but not limited to, clothing, ligatures, bedding or other household material, drinking cups, or cigarettes, and to material that is recovered from evidence and thereafter maintained separately from that evidence, including, but not limited to, on a slide, on a swab, in cuttings, or in scrapings.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> “Crime of violence” means the crimes cited in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/23-1331.html">23-1331</a>(4).</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> “DNA” means deoxyribonucleic acid.</p>

The term “law enforcement agencies” shall include law enforcement agencies that have entered into cooperative agreements with the Metropolitan Police Department pursuant to  § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-133.17.html">5-133.17</a>, to the extent the law enforcement agency is acting pursuant to such a cooperative agreement.</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Establishing how that evidence demonstrates that the movant is actually innocent despite having been convicted at trial or having pled guilty; and</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The motion shall include an affidavit by the movant, under penalty of perjury, stating that movant is actually innocent of the crime that is the subject of the motion, and that the new evidence was not deliberately withheld by the movant for purposes of strategic advantage.</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If, after considering the factors in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court concludes by clear and convincing evidence that the movant is actually innocent of the crime, the court shall vacate the conviction and dismiss the relevant count with prejudice.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty, and other charges were dismissed as part of a plea agreement, the court shall reinstate any charges of which the defendant has not demonstrated that the defendant is actually innocent.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same movant.</p>
