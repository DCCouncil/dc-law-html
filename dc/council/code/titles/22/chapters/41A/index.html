                <p>For the purposes of this chapter, the term:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> “Actual innocence” or “actually innocent” means that the person did not commit the crime of which he or she was convicted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> “Biological material” means the contents of a sexual assault examination kit, bodily fluids (including, but not limited to, blood, semen, saliva, and vaginal fluid), hair, skin tissue, fingernail scrapings, bone, or other human DNA source matter which apparently derived from the perpetrator of a crime or, under circumstances that may be probative of the perpetrator’s identity, apparently derived from the victim of a crime. This definition applies equally to material that is present on other evidence, including, but not limited to, clothing, ligatures, bedding or other household material, drinking cups, or cigarettes, and to material that is recovered from evidence and thereafter maintained separately from that evidence, including, but not limited to, on a slide, on a swab, in cuttings, or in scrapings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> “Crime of violence” means the crimes cited in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/23-1331.html">23-1331</a>(4).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> “DNA” means deoxyribonucleic acid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> “DNA testing” means forensic DNA analysis of biological material.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> “Law enforcement agencies” means the Metropolitan Police Department, the Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia, prosecutors, or any other governmental agency that has the authority to investigate, make arrests for, or prosecute or adjudicate District of Columbia criminal or delinquency offenses. The term “law enforcement agencies” shall include law enforcement agencies that have entered into cooperative agreements with the Metropolitan Police Department pursuant to  § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-133.17.html">5-133.17</a>, to the extent the law enforcement agency is acting pursuant to such a cooperative agreement.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Notwithstanding the time limits in any other provision of law, a motion for relief under this section may be made at any time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The motion shall set forth specific, non-conclusory facts:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Identifying the specific new evidence;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Establishing how that evidence demonstrates that the movant is actually innocent despite having been convicted at trial or having pled guilty; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Establishing why the new evidence is not cumulative or impeaching.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> The motion shall include an affidavit by the movant, under penalty of perjury, stating that movant is actually innocent of the crime that is the subject of the motion, and that the new evidence was not deliberately withheld by the movant for purposes of strategic advantage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The denial of a motion for relief under this section shall not be admissible in any prosecution based on the filing of a false affidavit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Unless the motion and files and records of the case conclusively show that the movant is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the prosecuting authority, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues, and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> The court may appoint counsel for an indigent movant under this section pursuant to Chapter 26 of Title 11.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> A movant shall be entitled to invoke the processes of discovery available under Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure or Civil Procedure, or elsewhere in the usages and principles of law if, and to the extent that, the judge, in the exercise of the judge’s discretion and for good cause shown, grants leave to do so, but not otherwise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> A motion for relief made pursuant to this section may be dismissed if the government demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced in its ability to respond to the motion by the delay in its filing, unless the movant shows that the motion is based on grounds which the movant could not have raised by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances prejudicial to the government occurred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> In determining whether to grant relief, the court may consider any relevant evidence, but shall consider the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The new evidence;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(B)">(B)</span> How the new evidence demonstrates actual innocence;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Why the new evidence is or is not cumulative or impeaching;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(D)">(D)</span> If the conviction resulted from a trial, and if the movant asserted a theory of defense inconsistent with the current claim of innocence, the specific reason the movant asserted an inconsistent theory at trial; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(E)">(E)</span> If the conviction resulted from a guilty plea, the specific reason the movant pleaded guilty despite being actually innocent of the crime.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> If, after considering the factors in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court concludes that it is more likely than not that the movant is actually innocent of the crime, the court shall grant a new trial.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> If, after considering the factors in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court concludes by clear and convincing evidence that the movant is actually innocent of the crime, the court shall vacate the conviction and dismiss the relevant count with prejudice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)">(4)</span> If the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty, and other charges were dismissed as part of a plea agreement, the court shall reinstate any charges of which the defendant has not demonstrated that the defendant is actually innocent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same movant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> An order entered on the motion is a final order for purposes of appeal.</p>
