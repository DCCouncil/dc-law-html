                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The Mayor shall establish the methodology for achieving the purposes of the Task Force in consultation with the members. The Task Force shall issue a report and recommendations proposing policy initiatives and revisions to the statute designed to improve subchapters IV and V of this chapter, which shall be distributed to all members of the Council and the Mayor and made available to the general public within 30 days after its issuance.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Simplifying the procedures for Time Certain Notices by establishing a single notice procedure for all transactions that do not require a notice to tenants, shortening time periods for sending or filing notices, and eliminating the Notice of Intent to File Petition;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> Allowing any tenant in a multi-unit housing accommodation to file a petition for a declaratory order without forming a tenant organization or extending the time period for a tenant organization to form and register;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(5)">(5)</span> Limiting this chapter to multi-unit housing accommodations;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(6)">(6)</span> Whether the third party rights afforded tenants are being employed to further the purposes of this chapter; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(7)">(7)</span> Whether owners are evading the requirements of this chapter.</p>
