                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> There is a continuing housing crisis in the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> There is a severe shortage of rental housing available to the citizens of the District of Columbia. The percentage of all rental housing units within the District of Columbia which are vacant, habitable, and available for occupancy is less than 5%  which is generally considered an indication of a serious shortage of rental housing units. The vacancy rate is substantially lower among units which can be afforded by lower income tenants as evidenced by serious overcrowding in private units and waiting lists for public housing in excess of 5,000 households.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Conversion of rental units to condominiums or cooperatives depletes the rental housing stock. Since 1977, more than 8,000 rental units in the District of Columbia have been converted to condominiums or cooperatives, more than 9,000 additional units have not yet been converted but have been declared eligible to do so and applications for 6,000 more units are pending. The 8,000 units which have been converted represent 4.5% of the District of Columbia’s 1977 rental stock, and the 15,000 units subject to conversion represent an additional 8.3%. These trends have been thoroughly investigated and documented by two legislative study commissions: The D.C. Legislative Commission on Housing and the Emergency Commission on Condominium and Cooperative Conversion. The latter Commission reported policy proposals, many of which are contained in this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Lower income tenants, particularly elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities, are the most adversely affected by conversions since the after conversion costs are usually beyond their ability to pay, which results in forced displacement, serious overcrowding, disproportionately high housing costs, and the loss of additional affordable rental housing stock. The threat of conversion has caused widespread fear and uncertainty among many tenants, particularly lower income tenants, elderly tenants and tenants with disabilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> The District of Columbia housing assistance plan shows that 43,521 renter households and 14,215 homeowner households are in need of housing assistance in the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> Very few rental units are being constructed or vacant units being made available for rental occupancy. More units are being converted to other uses or demolished than are being made available for rent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> Experience with conversions since passage of the Condominium Act of 1976 and the Condominium and Cooperative Stabilization Act of 1979 (D.C. Law 3-53) has demonstrated that the previous conversion controls have not been sufficiently effective in preserving rental housing, particularly for those who cannot afford homeownership. Based on that experience and the conclusions of the legislative study commissions, tenants who are most directly affected by the conversion should be provided with sufficient accurate information about the relative advantages and disadvantages to conversion of rental housing and should have a voice in the decision whether or not their rental housing should be converted. These controls are necessary to more effectively assure that housing will be preserved at a cost which can be afforded by current tenants who would otherwise be involuntarily displaced and forced into overcrowded or otherwise substandard housing conditions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(8)">(8)</span> These additional conversion controls are required to preserve the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In enacting the Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act of 1980 Amendments and Extension Act of 1983, the Council of the District of Columbia finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> A housing crisis continues in the District of Columbia that has not substantially improved since the passage of this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The chapter, as amended by the Rental Conversion and Sale Act of 1980 Amendment Act of 1982 (<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/4-196.html">D.C.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> The chapter, with additional amendments to address minor problems which have been identified since its passage, should be extended for 5 more years.</p>
