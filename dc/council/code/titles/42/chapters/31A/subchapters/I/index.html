                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1A)</span> The Mayor may request the Office of Administrative Hearings to issue, and the Office of Administrative Hearings may issue, a final order converting a special assessment lien to an administrative judgment. The Mayor may then cause the final order to be entered as a judgment against the owner in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The Mayor may enforce the judgment in the same manner as any other civil judgment may be enforced under District law.</p>

Subsequent to the enclosure, the Mayor shall give the owner notice as prescribed in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-3131.03.html">42-3131.03</a>.</p>

Any unexpended balance at the end of the year shall be reserved as a restricted fund balance and used to provide authorization to expend for subsequent years subject to the direction of the Mayor.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> There is established within the fund established by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph an account in which fees and penalties collected under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/6-916.html">6-916</a>(b), shall be deposited, to be expended for the purposes set forth in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/6-916.html">6-916</a>(b).</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Not later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, the Mayor shall submit to the Council a report of the financial condition of the fund, and any other special purpose revenue funds or capital project funds used for nuisance abatement activities, and the results of the operations and collections for the fiscal year. The report shall include an itemized accounting of all unrecovered taxes and penalties, the names of delinquent property owners, the nature of corrected building violations, and a detailed accounting of each expenditure. All funding sources shall be separately listed.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Mayor may cause the summary correction of housing regulation violations or violations of the construction codes where a life-or-health threatening condition exists, as determined by the Mayor. A life-or-health threatening condition means a condition that imminently endangers the health or safety of the tenant or occupant of the premises in a housing unit or housing accommodation, or that imminently endangers the health, safety, or welfare of the surrounding community. The condition may include, but is not limited to, a vacant building, as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-3131.05.html">42-3131.05</a>(5), or the interruption of electrical, heat, gas, water, or other essential services, when the interruption results from other than natural causes. The condition may also include the presence of graffiti. Except in the case of a vacant building, the Mayor shall notify promptly the owner or authorized agent that the correction is ordered within a specified time period. If at the time of this notice the owner is engaged in a good faith effort to make the necessary correction, the Mayor shall not commence corrective action unless and until the owner interrupts or ceases the effort. A good faith effort shall be one which is likely to cause the correction of the condition at least as soon as it could otherwise be corrected by the Mayor. The Mayor shall provide an opportunity for review of the summary corrective action without prejudice to the Mayor’s authority to take and complete that action. The owner or authorized agent shall be notified by personal service or by registered mail to the last known address and by conspicuous posting on the property. If the owner or address is unknown, or cannot be located, notice shall be provided by conspicuous posting on the property. The Mayor may assess all reasonable costs of correcting the condition and all expenses incident thereto as a tax against the property, to carry this tax on the regular tax rolls, and to collect the tax in the same manner as real estate taxes are collected. Monies in the revolving fund established by subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be available to cover the costs of the summary correction authorized by this subsection.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1A)</span> The Mayor may request the Office of Administrative Hearings to issue, and the Office of Administrative Hearings may issue, a final order converting a special assessment lien to an administrative judgment. The Mayor may then cause the final order to be entered as a judgment against the owner in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The Mayor may enforce the judgment in the same manner as any other civil judgment may be enforced under District law.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> For the purposes of this subsection, the presence of graffiti shall be deemed to be a housing regulation violation.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> In the case of graffiti which does not constitute a life-or-health threatening condition, but which constitutes a nuisance, the Mayor may order the removal of the graffiti within a specified time period and, subject to 7 days’ notice to the owner or an authorized agent in the manner provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection and an opportunity for review of the order, the Mayor may remove the graffiti if the owner does not comply.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor may charge any property owner whose property is the subject of corrective action, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, or any property owner who receives a notice to correct wrongful conditions pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/6-804.html">6-804</a>(c) a fee to cover the administrative costs incurred by the District of Columbia in its efforts to provide that the violation be corrected. The Mayor may assess this fee as a tax against the property, may carry this tax on the regular tax rolls, and may collect this tax in the same manner as real estate taxes are collected.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The Mayor may defer or forgive, in whole or in part, any cost or fee assessed pursuant to §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-3131.01.html">42-3131.01</a> to 42-3131.03 with respect to any qualified real property approved pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/6-1503.html">6-1503</a>.</p>

Any person who shall hinder, interfere with, or prevent any inspection or work authorized by this subchapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine not exceeding $100 or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 3 months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Mayor may apply to a judge of the District of Columbia for an administrative search warrant to enter any premises to conduct any inspection required or authorized by law to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The application for an administrative search warrant shall be in writing and sworn to by the applicant and shall particularly describe the place, structure, or premises to be inspected and the nature, scope, and purpose of the inspection to be performed by the applicant.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Before filing an application for an administrative search warrant with a court, the Mayor shall obtain approval by the Office of the Attorney General as to its legality in both form and substance under the standards and criteria of this section and a statement to this effect shall be included as part of the application.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> A judge of a court referred to in this section may issue the warrant on finding that:</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span><span class="level-num">(I)</span> After requesting, at a reasonable time, the owner, tenant, or other individual in charge of the property to allow access, has been denied access to the property; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> After making a reasonable effort, the applicant has been unable to locate any of these individuals;</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Probable cause for the issuance of the warrant has been demonstrated by the applicant by specific evidence of an existing violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted under this chapter or by showing that:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> A reasonable administrative inspection program exists regarding the condition of the property; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> The proposed inspection comes within the program.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> An administrative search warrant issued under this section shall specify the place, structure, premise, vehicle, or records to be inspected. The inspection conducted shall not exceed the limits specified in the warrant.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> An administrative search warrant issued under this section authorizes the applicant and other officials or employees of the District to enter specified property to perform the inspection, sampling, and other functions authorized by law to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> An administrative search warrant issued under this section shall be executed and returned to the judge by whom it was issued within:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The time specified in the warrant, not to exceed 30 days; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> If no time period is specified in the warrant, 15 days from the date of its issuance.</p>
