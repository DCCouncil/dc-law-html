                <p>The Council finds that, despite the fact that the District has some of the most comprehensive pro-tenant laws in the United States:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Tenants in the District are under-informed of their rights.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> It is difficult for tenants to obtain information.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Tenants cannot usually afford legal representation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Tenants are under-informed about dispute mediation and adjudication options available to tenants in the District through the courts and through the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Few tenants have time for self-advocacy because of their full-time employment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Tenants in the District need an independent Chief Tenant Advocate to act on their behalf as repository of information and resources to help guide tenants through the landlord-tenant system in the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The establishment of an independent Office of the Tenant Advocate will provide a valuable resource for the government and residents of the District.</p>
