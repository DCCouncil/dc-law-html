Such a petition shall be clearly identified as an election instead of the general adjustments authorized by subsection (b) of this section.

In the case of any petition filed under this subsection as to which a final decision has not been rendered by the Rent Administrator at the end of 90 days from the date of filing of the petition and as to which the housing provider is not in default in complying with any information request made under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-3502.16.html">42-3502.16</a>, the rent charged adjustment requested in the petition may be conditionally implemented by the housing provider at the end of the 90-day period.

If a hearing has been held on the petition, the Rent Administrator shall, by order served upon the parties at least 10 days prior to the expiration of the 90 days, make a provisional finding as to the rent charged adjustment justified by the order, if any.
