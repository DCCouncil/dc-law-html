                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/15-205.html">D.C. Law 15-205</a> substituted “$16” for “$15” and substituted “; provided, that a portion of fees collected shall be deposited in a special account to fund a tenant ombudsman and a housing provider ombudsman and an Advisory Neighborhood Commission liaison.” for “; provided, that fees collected during fiscal year 2001 shall be deposited in the fund established by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/6-711.01.html">6-711.01</a> to be used for the purposes of the fund.”</p>

The fee shall be paid annually to the District government at the time the housing provider applies for a business license or a renewal of the license; or in the case of a housing accommodation for which no license is required, at the time and in the manner the Commission may determine. Fees shall be deposited in a timely manner in depositories designated by the District government for those purposes; provided, that a portion of fees collected shall be deposited in a special account to fund a housing provider ombudsman and an Advisory Neighborhood Commission liaison; provided further, that a portion of fees collected shall be deposited in a special account for use by the Office of the Chief Tenant Advocate.”</p>

(b), which had read as follows: “(b) There is established as a nonlapsing fund the Office of the Chief Tenant Advocate Rental Accommodations Fee Fund (’Fund’). All funds deposited into the Fund, and any interest earned on those funds, shall not revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of a fiscal year, or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in this section without regard to fiscal year limitation, subject to authorization by Congress.”</p>
