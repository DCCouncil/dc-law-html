                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The Mayor may provide tax abatements and deferral or forgiveness of water and sewer fees and other indebtedness to the District as incentives for the development of single-room-occupancy housing for low- and moderate-income tenants. These incentives shall be provided pursuant to negotiations and written agreements between the Mayor and housing providers engaged in the development or operation of single-room-occupancy housing accommodations. In these negotiations and written agreements, the Mayor may establish a formula for abating property tax liability for properties developed pursuant to this section for a period of not more than 10 years beginning during the first year that newly-constructed or rehabilitated single-room-occupancy housing becomes available for occupancy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The incentives provided by this section shall be available for new construction, renovation of any vacant rental housing accommodation, or renovation of any non-housing property, whether vacant or not, for single-room-occupancy housing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> To qualify for the incentives provided by this section, the housing provider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Mayor that the single-room-occupancy housing meets the following minimum standards:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Rental rates are affordable for low- and moderate-income tenants and reflect costs offset by the tax abatements and deferral or forgiveness of indebtedness to the District provided pursuant to this section;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The location is in compliance with the Zoning Regulations of the District of Columbia;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Each rental unit includes no less than 95 square feet of space, and a clothing storage unit;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> Toilet and shower or bathing facilities are provided on each floor where tenants reside, in a reasonable size to meet the needs of the tenants residing on that floor;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> A common-space day room, kitchen, and laundry facilities sufficient to meet the needs of all tenants at 100% occupancy are provided;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)">(6)</span> A 24-hour security system, either manual or electronic, is provided; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(7)">(7)</span> The housing accommodation has a resident manager who resides on the premises.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Within 180 days from August 25, 1994, the Mayor shall compile, provide to the Council, and publish in the District of Columbia Register an initial list of District-owned and privately-owned properties in the District that are available and suitable for the development of single-room-occupancy housing in accordance with this section. At least annually thereafter, the Mayor shall publish a revised list and provide a written report to the Council regarding the status of single-room-occupancy housing development at these and other sites.</p>
