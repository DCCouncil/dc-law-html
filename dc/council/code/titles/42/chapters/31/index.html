                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> If the existence of a drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance is found, the court shall enter an order permanently enjoining, abating, and preventing the continuance or recurrence of the nuisance. In order to effectuate fully the equitable remedy of abatement, such order may include damages as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-3111.html">42-3111</a>. The court may grant declaratory relief or any other relief deemed necessary to accomplish the purposes of the judgment.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Ordering all rental income for the property transferred to a trustee, to be appointed by the court, who shall be empowered to use the rental income to make reasonable expenditures related to the property in order to abate the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The number of times the owner or tenant has been notified of drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related problems at the property;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Prior efforts or lack of efforts by the defendant to abate the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The involvement of the owner or tenant in the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> The costs incurred by the jurisdiction or by the community-based organization in investigating, correcting, or attempting to correct the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(9)</span> Whether the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance was continuous or recurring;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(10)</span> The economic or financial benefit accruing or likely to accrue to the defendant as a result of the conditions constituting the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance; or</p>
