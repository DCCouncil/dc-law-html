                <p>A person having the right to designate the recipient of property transferable upon the occurrence of a future event may revocably nominate a custodian to receive the property for a minor beneficiary upon the occurrence of the event by naming the custodian followed in substance by the words: “as custodian for ____________ [name of minor] under the District of Columbia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.” The nomination may name 1 or more persons as substituted custodians to whom the property must be transferred, in the order named, if the first nominated custodian dies before the transfer or is unable, declines, or is ineligible to serve. The nomination may be made in a will, a trust, a deed, an instrument exercising a power of appointment, or in a writing designating a beneficiary of contractual rights which is registered with or delivered to the payor, the issuer, or other obligor of the contractual rights.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> A custodian shall perform the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Take control of custodial property;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Register or record title to custodial property if appropriate; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries. If a custodian has a special skill or expertise or is named custodian on the basis of representations of special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise. However, a custodian, in the custodian’s discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor’s estate, may retain custodial property received from a transferor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> The life of the minor only if the minor or the minor’s estate is the sole beneficiary; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the extent that the minor, the minor’s estate, or the custodian in the capacity of custodian is the irrevocable beneficiary.</p>
                <p>A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is properly identified if the minor’s interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is properly identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration is properly identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words: “as a custodian for ____________ [name of minor] under the District of Columbia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act”.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> A custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial property, including information necessary for the preparation of the minor’s tax returns, and shall make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent or legal representative of the minor or by the minor, if the minor has reached the age of 14 years.</p>

Otherwise, the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under section 21-309(a).
