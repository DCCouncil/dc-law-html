                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The reference to January 1, 2011 in this subsection shall, if the Federal estate and generation-skipping transfer tax becomes effective before that date, refer instead to the first date on which the tax shall become legally effective.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The personal representative or any affected beneficiary under the will or other instrument may bring a proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the references under subsection (a) of this section be construed with respect to the law as it existed after December 31, 2009. The proceeding shall be commenced within 12 months following the death of the testator or grantor, and not thereafter.</p>
