                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> By an act or an omission, caused or contributed to the contamination of a property if at the time of the act or omission, the person knew or had reason to know that the act or omission would cause the contamination of the property; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)">(6)</span> Knew or had reason to know that a property is contaminated and transferred ownership of the contaminated property after June 13, 2001, except if it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the person did not participate in the management of the property, did not directly cause the contamination, and that the person:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)(A)">(A)</span> Acquired the contaminated property by inheritance or bequest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)(B)">(B)</span> Holds ownership in the contaminated property or in property located on the contaminated property primarily to protect a valid and enforceable lien;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)(F)">(F)</span> Except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct is an agency of the District government;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)(G)">(G)</span> Is a lender who extends credit for the performance of voluntary cleanup actions performed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)(H)">(H)</span> Is a lender who takes action to protect or preserve a mortgage or a deed of trust on a contaminated property or a security interest in property located on a contaminated property, by stabilizing, containing, removing, or preventing the contamination in a manner that does not cause or contribute to a contamination or significantly increase the threat of contamination. The lender must provide advance written notice of its actions to DDOE, or in the event of an emergency in which action is required within 12 hours, provides notice by telephone. The lender, prior to taking the action, is not a responsible party, and the action taken does not violate any provision of this chapter. Except that if the lender shall contribute to or cause further contamination to the property while taking any action pursuant to this subparagraph, the lender shall be liable solely for costs incurred as a result of the contamination which the lender caused or to which the lender contributed.</p>

To determine that a person did not know or did not have reason to know, a court shall consider any specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the person, the relationship of the purchase price to the value of the property if uncontaminated, commonly known or reasonably ascertainable information about the property, the obviousness of the presence or the likely presence of contamination at the property, and the ability to detect such contamination by appropriate inspection.</p>
