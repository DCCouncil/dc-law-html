The Mayor shall determine the assessed value of the interest or use in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-820.html">47-820</a>(a)(3) as if the lessee or user of the real property were the owner of the real property and the real property were not exempt or immune from taxation; provided, that the taxable value may be adjusted by the Mayor to reflect the duration of the interest or use remaining; provided further, that the Mayor may impute a duration of the interest or use based upon the intent, actions, and policies of the parties to the conveyance, the history of the real property, the perception of third parties, and written documents.</p>
