The selection committee shall screen, interview, and select the first 32 members of the Youth Council. Following the first year, Youth Council members shall select the next year’s members. The selection committee shall consist of:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Twice as many young people as adults;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Representatives of community based organizations;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Representatives of faith based organizations; and</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Representatives of government.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Youth Council shall select 6 officers to serve leadership positions. In addition, the Youth Council may create other leadership positions as deemed necessary. In its first year of operation, the Chair shall be chosen by the selection committee from among the initial 32 Youth Council members, with the approval of the Mayor. The Chair shall serve for one year. The selection of these 32 members shall be made prior to the Youth Council’s initial retreat.
