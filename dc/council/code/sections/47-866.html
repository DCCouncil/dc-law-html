                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A property which receives a tax abatement under this section shall be maintained as an eligible low-income housing development throughout the 5-year tax abatement period.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The tax abatement provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be allowed only if:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An application requesting certification of the housing accommodation and planned improvements as eligible for the tax abatement is submitted to the Mayor at least 30 days before physical improvements to the property are begun;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Mayor approves the application submitted under paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Mayor certifies completion of the improvements;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The property is maintained as an eligible low-income housing development during each tax year for which the reduction would be allowed;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The improvements are made after December 31, 2001; and</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor may certify a housing accommodation as eligible to receive the tax abatement allowed by this section if at least 25% of the units are affordable to a household consisting of one or more individuals with a household income equal to, or less than, 50% of the area median income, and the Mayor determines, in writing and pursuant to rules promulgated by the Mayor, that the improvements are not likely to be made unless the tax abatement is received.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The tax abatement shall be computed by the Office of Tax and Revenue by comparing the assessment of the qualified property for the first year that the property is qualified or the assessment in any succeeding year and comparing it to the assessment in the base year which is the assessment on the tax roll for the year preceding the first year for which the tax abatement is first received less any new construction first assessed in the base year. The tax abatement percentage shall be applied to the difference between base year assessment and the current year’s assessment for each tax year. The Mayor shall certify to the Office of Tax and Revenue that each property owner and each property qualifies for the program annually regarding income level and mix of tenants.</p>
