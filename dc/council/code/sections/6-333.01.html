Whenever real property is acquired for such a program or project on or after January 2, 1971, such Mayor or Authority, as the case may be, shall make all payments and meet all requirements prescribed for a federal agency by title III of this act.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If a housing accommodation within the geographic boundaries of the District of Columbia is converted into a condominium or cooperative, substantially rehabilitated or demolished, or discontinued from housing use, the Mayor shall provide relocation services in the manner required by subsection (a) of this section to low-income tenants who move from the accommodation. Services include, at a minimum, ascertaining the relocation needs for each household, providing current information on the availability of comparable housing of suitable size, supplying information concerning federal and District housing programs, and providing counseling to displaced persons in order to minimize hardships in adjusting to relocation.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> For purposes of this section, the term:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> “Comparable housing” means rental or homeownership units with equivalent benefits and services included in the monthly payments.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> “Suitable size” means for a 1-person family, an efficiency unit; for a 2-person family, a 1-bedroom unit; for a family of 3 or 4 persons, a 2-bedroom unit; for a family of 5 or 6 persons, a 3-bedroom unit; and for a family of 7 or more persons, a 4-bedroom unit. In addition, the meaning of the term “suitable size” is increased as necessary to allow children and unmarried adults of the opposite sex to have separate sleeping rooms. In determining the meaning of the term “suitable size,” 1 person living in a 1-bedroom unit is eligible for relocation in a 1-bedroom comparable unit.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>

Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p></section></section></section></section>
