The application shall be considered complete upon the SHPDA’s receipt of the applicant’s response to any such request.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The SHPDA shall issue its determination on an application for a certificate of need within 90 days after the date that the review process begins. If the SHPDA cannot issue its determination within that period, the review period may be extended for one additional period of 30 days.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The SHPDA shall provide the applicant, the SHCC, and all previously appearing parties with a detailed explanation of any decision.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The general public shall have access to all applications reviewed by the SHPDA and all other written materials essential to SHPDA’s review contained in the SHPDA’s files, except that the SHPDA shall establish a procedure to restrict access of the general public from portions of applications or supporting documents which contain detailed descriptions of security systems, medical record systems, controlled storage systems or proprietary financial information. The SHPDA is authorized to charge reasonable fees for the costs of providing to the public documents covered under this subsection.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> In issuing a certificate of need, the SHPDA shall specify in the certificate the maximum amount of capital expenditures which may be obligated under the certificate.

The SHPDA shall modify or remove a condition upon application at any time by the holder of the certificate of need or other person if the circumstances upon which the condition is premised change and no longer justify the condition, or if the condition, for any other reason, is no longer appropriate.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> There shall be no ex parte contacts:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> In the case of an application for a certificate of need, between the applicant for a certificate of need, any person in favor of or opposed to the issuance of a certificate of need for the applicant, and any person in the SHPDA who exercises any responsibility with respect to the application after the commencement of the hearing on the applicant’s application and before a decision is made with respect to the applicant; or</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> In the case of a proposed withdrawal of a certificate of need, between the holder of the certificate of need, any person acting on behalf of the holder, or any person in favor of or opposed to the withdrawal and any person in the SHPDA who exercises any responsibility with respect to the application after the commencement of the hearing on the applicant’s application and before a decision is made with respect to the application.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In the case where no public hearing on the application has been requested, the period of prohibition of ex parte contacts shall begin upon the adjournment of any meeting convened by the SHCC at which the application is considered. Whether or not a hearing has been held, information presented at such meeting shall not be considered ex parte contacts if the meeting chairperson affords an opportunity for rebuttal. If there is to be no hearing or public meeting, the period of prohibition of ex parte contacts shall begin upon the SHPDA’s determination to conduct a type of review for which no public meeting or hearing will be held.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> No certificate of need holder shall begin operation of the bed, facility, or health service approved in the certificate of need until the SHPDA has conducted a review to determine compliance with the certificate of need requirements. If the SHPDA does not make a finding of noncompliance within 30 days of receiving notification from the certificate of need holder of its intent to begin operation, the SHPDA shall be deemed to have determined compliance.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> SHPDA shall require that all prospective certificate of need applicants certify, in writing, that for the five-year period following the award of the certificate of need the percentage of uncompensated care (charity and bad-debt) provided each year to the population served by the HCF will be equal to or exceed the average of the percentage of uncompensated care provided by the HCF for the 2 fiscal years immediately preceding the review of an application for a certificate of need pursuant to this section.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
