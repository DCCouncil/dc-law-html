The report accompanying the final Construction Codes revisions shall include a listing and description of each green building practice considered and why each practice was, or was not included, in the respective Construction Codes revision. By June 1, 2013, and after at least every 3 years by June 1 of the relevant year, the Mayor shall submit to the Council for approval Construction Codes revisions that are consistent with the requirements of this section, and that incorporate green building practices developed since the previous Construction Codes revisions.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
