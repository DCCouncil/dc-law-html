                <p>1973 Ed., § 28:7-202.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</strong> Section 2, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> Exemption for field warehouse receipts added in subsection (2)(e).</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes:</strong> To make clear that the formal requirements of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act are continued but not to displace particular legislation requiring other or different specifications of form. See  Sections 7-103 and  10-103. This section does not require that a receipt be issued but states formal requirements for those which are issued.</p>
                <p><strong>Cross References:</strong>Sections 7-103 and  10-103.</p>
                <p><strong>Definitional Cross References:</strong> “Bearer”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Delivery”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Goods”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Person”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Security interest”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Term”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Warehouse receipt”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Warehouseman”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Written”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p><strong>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</strong> Former  Section 7-202.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> Language is updated to accommodate electronic commerce and to reflect modern style.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes:</strong> 1. This section does not displace any particular legislation that requires other terms in a warehouse receipt or that may require a particular form of a warehouse receipt. This section does not require that a warehouse receipt be issued. A warehouse receipt that is issued need not contain any of the terms listed in subsection (b) in order to qualify as a warehouse receipt as long as the receipt falls within the definition of “warehouse receipt” in Article 1. Thus the title has been changed to eliminate the phrase “essential terms” as provided in prior law. The only consequence of a warehouse receipt not containing any term listed in subsection (b) is that a person injured by a term’s omission has a right as against the warehouse for harm caused by the omission. Cases, such as  In re Celotex Corp., 134 B. R. 993 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1991), that held that in order to have a valid warehouse receipt all of the terms listed in this section must be contained in the receipt, are disapproved.</p>
                <p>2. The unique identification code referred to in subsection (b)(3) can include any combination of letters, number, signs, and/or symbols that provide a unique identification. Whether an electronic or tangible warehouse receipt contains a signature will be resolved with the definition of sign in  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p><strong>Cross References:</strong>Sections 7-103 and  7-401.</p>
                <p><strong>Definitional Cross References:</strong> “Bearer”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Delivery”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Goods”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Person”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Security interest”.  Section 1-201.</p>
