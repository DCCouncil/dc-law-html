    </p><h4>Editor's Notes</h4><p>
       Applicability of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-182.html">D.C. Law 21-182</a>: <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-182.html#§18">§ 18 of D.C. Law 21-182</a> provided that the creation of this section by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-182.html#§11">§ 11 of D.C. Law 21-182</a> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore the change made to this section by that amendment has been delayed.
      </p><p> A certification dated June 6, 2017, that the fiscal effect of the Death with Dignity Act of 2016, D.C. Law 21-182, has been included in an approved budget and financial plan was published in the D.C. Register on June 16, 2017 (64 DCR 5670). Therefore the creation of this section by that amendment has been implemented.</p></section></section></section></section>
