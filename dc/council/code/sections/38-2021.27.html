                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this part to the contrary, benefits under this part are subject to the limitations imposed by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as adjusted from time to time and, to that end, effective for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2008:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> To the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to the remainder of this subsection, the maximum monthly benefit to which any teacher may be entitled in any limitation year with respect to his or her accrued retirement benefit, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.21.html">38-2021.21</a> (hereafter referred to as the “maximum benefit”), shall not exceed the defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted as provided in this subsection). In addition to the foregoing, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to this subsection), the maximum annual additions for any limitation year shall be equal to the lesser of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)(i)">(i)</span> The dollar limit on annual additions; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> 100% of the teacher’s remuneration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The defined benefit dollar limit and the dollar limit on annual additions shall be adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe. The dollar limit as adjusted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies, but a teacher’s benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit before January 1 of that calendar year. To the extent that the monthly benefit payable to a teacher who has reached his or her termination date is limited by the application of this subsection, the limit shall be adjusted to reflect subsequent adjustments made in accordance with section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but the adjusted limit shall apply only to benefits payable on or after January 1 of the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Benefits shall be actuarially adjusted based upon the defined benefit dollar limit, as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)">(A)</span> There shall be an adjustment for benefits payable in a form other than a straight life annuity as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(i)">(i)</span> If a monthly benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, before applying the defined benefit dollar limit, the benefit shall be adjusted, in the manner described in sub-subparagraphs (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, to the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits), or in the case of a form of benefit not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, the inclusion of a feature under which a benefit increases automatically to the extent permitted to reflect cost-of-living adjustments and the increase, if any, in the defined benefit dollar limit under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> If the benefit of a teacher is paid in a form not subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity (without regard to cost-of-living adjustments described in this subsection) is equal to the greater of the annual amount of the straight life annuity, if any, payable to the teacher commencing at the same time, or the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(iii)">(iii)</span> If the benefit of a teacher is paid in a form subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(iii)(I)">(I)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity having a commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the definition of actuarial equivalent for adjusting benefits in the same form;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(iii)(II)">(II)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using a 5.5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(iii)(III)">(III)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher’s form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, divided by 1.05.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(A)(iv)">(iv)</span> For the purposes of this subparagraph, whether a form of benefit is subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code is determined without regard to the status of this part as a government plan as described in section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)">(B)</span> There shall be an adjustment to benefits that commence before age 62 or after age 65 as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(i)">(i)</span> If the benefit of a teacher begins before age 62, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at age 62 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this part provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(i)(I)">(I)</span> The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(i)(II)">(II)</span> The defined benefit dollar limit, adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable, multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. The adjustment in this sub-subparagraph shall not apply as a result of benefits paid on account of disability under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.04.html">38-2021.04</a> or as a result of the death of a teacher under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.09.html">38-2021.09</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> If the benefit of a teacher begins after age 65, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the defined benefit dollar limit applicable at age 65 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this part provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I)">(I)</span> The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(ii)(II)">(II)</span> The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for participation of less than 10 years, if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at the age the benefit commences is the annual amount of the annuity payable to the teacher, computed disregarding the teacher’s accruals after age 65 but including any actuarial adjustments, even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this part at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under this part to a hypothetical teacher who is age 65 and has the same annuity as the teacher.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(iii)">(iii)</span> For the purposes of this subparagraph, no adjustment shall be made to the defined benefit dollar limit to reflect the probability of a teacher’s death between the commencing date and age 62, or between age 65 and the commencing date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the teacher before the annuity having a commencing date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the date the benefits first commence, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the teacher’s death if the benefit provided under this part does not charge the teacher for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code) upon the teacher’s death.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> If the teacher has fewer than 10 years of participation in the defined benefit portion of this part (as determined under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and associated regulations), the defined benefit dollar limit shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation under this part and the denominator of which is 10. The adjustment in this paragraph shall not apply to benefits paid on account of disability under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.04.html">38-2021.04</a>(d) or as a result of the death of a teacher under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.09.html">38-2021.09</a>.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)(A)">(A)</span> The limitations contained in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection and this paragraph shall not apply to the portion of the teacher’s accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.08.html">38-2021.08</a> that are actuarially funded by:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> In addition to the foregoing, the maximum benefit and contributions shall be reduced, and the rate of benefit accrual shall be frozen or reduced accordingly, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to any teacher who is also a participant in:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)(A)">(A)</span> Any other tax-qualified retirement plan maintained by the District of Columbia, including a defined benefit plan in which an individual medical benefit account, as described in section 415(l) of the Internal Revenue Code, has been established for the teacher;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> The application of the provisions of this subsection shall not cause the maximum permissible benefit for a teacher to be less than the teacher’s annuity under this part as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007 under provisions of this part that were both adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007 and that satisfied the limitations under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007.</p>
