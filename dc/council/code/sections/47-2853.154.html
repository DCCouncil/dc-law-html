                <p>“(a) There is established a fund designated as the Appraisal Education Fund (‘Fund’), which shall be separate from the General Fund of the District of Columbia and shall be used by the Board for the purpose of raising the standards of practice and the competency of licensees and certificate holders by:</p>
