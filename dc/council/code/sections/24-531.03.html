                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> When the issue of a defendant’s competence has been raised, the court shall order a preliminary screening examination before ordering a full competence examination pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The court shall schedule a return date or time for the defendant as early as possible following the order for the preliminary screening examination issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. In no case shall the return date be more than 3 business days after the order if the defendant is not released and no more than 5 business days after the order if the defendant is released.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The examination shall be completed and a report submitted to the court in advance of the return date or time.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> The court shall consider the report of the preliminary screening examination, any arguments made by the parties, and any other information available to the court, and shall either:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> Any time it determines that the criteria for an inpatient examination set forth in subsection (e) of this section are no longer met.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(B)">(B)</span> If the defendant is reported incompetent, the report shall include an opinion regarding the likelihood of the defendant’s attaining competence in the foreseeable future or should state that no opinion has been formed on the likelihood of the defendant attaining competence.</p>
