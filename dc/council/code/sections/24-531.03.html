                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> When the issue of a defendant’s competence has been raised, the court shall order a preliminary screening examination before ordering a full competence examination pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> A preliminary screening examination shall be performed either in the courthouse or on an outpatient basis by a psychiatrist or psychologist affiliated with the Department of Mental Health.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The court shall schedule a return date or time for the defendant as early as possible following the order for the preliminary screening examination issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. In no case shall the return date be more than 3 business days after the order if the defendant is not released and no more than 5 business days after the order if the defendant is released.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The examination shall be completed and a report submitted to the court in advance of the return date or time.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> The court shall consider the report of the preliminary screening examination, any arguments made by the parties, and any other information available to the court, and shall either:</p>

The court may order the defendant committed to Saint Elizabeths Hospital or to the Department of Mental Health for an inpatient examination only after a finding by the court that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Placement in an inpatient treatment facility is necessary in order to conduct an adequate examination; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> Any time it determines that the criteria for an inpatient examination set forth in subsection (e) of this section are no longer met.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(B)">(B)</span> If the defendant is reported incompetent, the report shall include an opinion regarding the likelihood of the defendant’s attaining competence in the foreseeable future or should state that no opinion has been formed on the likelihood of the defendant attaining competence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(C)">(C)</span> If a report indicates that the criteria for an inpatient examination set forth in subsection (e) of this section are no longer met, the court shall make new findings under subsection (e) of this section and, if it determines that the examination can be conducted on an outpatient basis, shall determine the defendant’s eligibility for pretrial release pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 23 of Title 16 or subchapter II of Chapter 13 of Title 23, if it has not previously done so. If necessary, the court may enter a new order for a full competence examination to be completed on an outpatient basis.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> The Department of Mental Health shall submit a written report to the court at any time it determines that the criteria for an inpatient examination set forth in subsection (e) of this section are met.
