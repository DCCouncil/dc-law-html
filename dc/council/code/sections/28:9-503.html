                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, if the debtor is a registered organization or the collateral is held in a trust that is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name that is stated to be the registered organization’s name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the registered organization’s jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the registered organization’s name;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Subject to subsection (f) of this section, if the collateral is being administered by the personal representative of a decedent, only if the financing statement provides, as the name of the debtor, the name of the decedent and, in a separate part of the financing statement, indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the collateral is held in a trust that is not a registered organization, only if the financing statement:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Provides, as the name of the debtor:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If the organic record of the trust specifies a name for the trust, the name specified; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> If the organic record of the trust does not specify a name for the trust, the name of the settlor or testator; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> In a separate part of the financing statement:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph, indicates that the collateral is held in a trust; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> If the name is provided in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, provides additional information sufficient to distinguish the trust from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors or the same testator and indicates that the collateral is held in a trust, unless the additional information so indicates;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Subject to subsection (g) of this section, if the debtor is an individual to whom the District has issued a driver’s license that has not expired, or to whom the agency of the District that issues driver’s licenses has issued, instead of a driver’s license, a special identification card that has not become invalid, only if the financing statement provides the name of the individual which is indicated on the driver’s license or special identification card;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> If the debtor is an individual to whom paragraph (4) of this subsection does not apply, only if the financing statement provides the individual name of the debtor or the surname and first personal name of the debtor; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> In other cases:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> If the debtor has a name, only if the financing statement provides the organizational name of the debtor; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> If the debtor does not have a name, only if it provides the names of the partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor, in a manner that each name provided would be sufficient if the person named were the debtor.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (a) of this section is not rendered ineffective by the absence of:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A trade name or other name of the debtor; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Unless required under subsection (a)(6)(B) of this section, names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> A financing statement that provides only the debtor’s trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The name of the decedent indicated on the order appointing the personal representative of the decedent issued by the court having jurisdiction over the collateral is sufficient as the “name of the decedent” under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> If the District has issued to an individual more than one driver’s license, or special identification card, of a kind described in subsection (a)(4) of this section, the one that was issued most recently is the one to which subsection (a)(4) of this section refers.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> In this section, the “name of the settlor or testator” means:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the settlor is a registered organization, the name that is stated to be the settlor’s name on the public organic record most recently filed with or issued or enacted by the settlor’s jurisdiction of organization which purports to state, amend, or restate the settlor’s name; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In other cases, the name of the settlor or testator indicated in the trust’s organic record.</p>
