These problems were identified by the Commission on the Organization of the Government of the District Government (the Nelsen Commission) as well as by the Special Citizens Advisory Commission on Urban Renewal.<p:em>The Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA)</p:em> is responsible for executing Urban Renewal Plans that have been adopted by the National Capital Planning Commission and approval by the District of Columbia Council after public hearings in accordance with the D.C. Redevelopment Act, as amended.      
        <p:em>The Office of Housing and Community Development</p:em> is charged with:      
        identifying the current and future housing and community development needs of the District of Columbia;developing a strategy for best meeting those needs; andensuring the planning and coordination of programs, projects and other activities necessary to carry out that strategy.<p:em>The National Capital Housing Authority</p:em> is responsible for the management of the more than 11,800 dwelling units which comprise the District of Columbia's public housing stock and, in addition, is responsible for the development and identification of new housing resources.      
        <p:em>The D.C. Model Cities Program</p:em> carries out a combined program of housing and economic development and related social support services in a selected area (Service Area Six) of the District, as authorized and funded by the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966.      
        <p:em>The Housing, Zoning and Building Code Enforcement Bureau of the Department of Economic Development</p:em> is responsible for providing community protection through an extensive program of examining buildings - structures, equipment, and plans for compliance with applicable D.C. codes.      
        PLAN TO ESTABLISH A DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENTThis plan consolidates the activities of a number of offices and agencies: the Office of Housing and Community Development, the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, the National Capital Housing Authority, the Model Cities Commission, and the Housing, Building, and Zoning Divisions of the Department of Economic Development. These functions are placed in a single Department under a Director who, in addition, is designated as the National Capital Housing Authority and who is also delegated authority to prescribe the by-laws, rules, and regulations which govern the exercise of the powers of the Redevelopment Land Agency. Staff support services for the Board for the Condemnation of Insanitary Buildings, the Condemnation Review Board, the Relocation Advisory Committee, the Urban Renewal Operations Committee, the Building Code Advisory Committee, and the Mayor's Advisory Committee on Fort Lincoln are also to be provided by the Department.The need for more effective coordination and less administrative complexity is expected to be achieved by the unification of the above functions.A)        
          <p:em>Objective One: A consolidated housing and community development effort:</p:em> The Department of Housing and Community Development will provide the central focus for directing programs that encompass all housing and community development within the District.      
        B)        
          <p:em>Objective Two: A more efficient utilization of Resources:</p:em> By consolidating presently fragmented functions, economies could be achieved by reducing overlap and duplication of effort, newly-formed functions can be funded by a redirection of present resources.      
        C)        
          <p:em>Anticipated Benefits to be accrued by Reorganization Plan No. 3:</p:em>
        Near-term:<p:strong>1.</p:strong> A central entity within the District to address issues affecting overall city-wide community development.
        <p:strong>2.</p:strong> Closer coordination and planning of priorities.
        <p:strong>3.</p:strong> Expansion of technical and professional staff within existing resources.
        <p:strong>4.</p:strong> Greater flexibility for applying available resources to program needs.
        <p:strong>5.</p:strong> A more efficient utilization of available professional, technical and administrative staff skills.
        Long-term:<p:strong>1.</p:strong> Program expansion through redirection of existing resources and through normal employee turnover.
        <p:strong>2.</p:strong> Cost savings by consolidating administrative functions such as personnel, finance, procurement and computer services.
        ELEMENTS OF REORGANIZATION PACKAGEThe supplements of this Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1975 are attached as follows:A. 
          <p:em>Organization Chart:</p:em>This chart outlines the structure of the new Department.
        B. 
          <p:em>Functional Statement:</p:em> A list, keyed to the chart, of the functions of the principal units.      
        C. 
          <p:em>Schedule of Existing Positions:</p:em> The first purpose of this printout is to indicate the tentative arrangement of positions along functional lines within the Department. This is not a proposed realignment. The second purpose is to list every position, filled or not, the grade, salary, job title, and the source of funding.      
        D. 
          <p:em>Reorganization Process Timetable:</p:em> The timetable for full implementation of the desired reorganization.
