Subject to the limitation set forth in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/34-2407.02.html">34-2407.02</a>, each of the taxing agencies shall, within 30 days after receiving the notice, submit a statement to the Mayor certifying all taxes appearing on its records then due to the District as of the date of the Mayor’s notice that have not been previously certified to the Mayor. The statement shall be in the form and medium, and shall contain the information, that the Mayor requires. In addition to the real property taxes due, the Mayor shall include in the notices required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1341.html">47-1341</a> and § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1353.01.html">47-1353.01</a> and in the public notice required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1342.html">47-1342</a> the taxes certified to him by the taxing agencies.</p>

The notice shall state the name of the owner, describe the real property by taxation square, suffix, and lot number, or parcel and lot number, and specify the amount of the lien.</p>
