                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Notwithstanding any other law or regulation, no car registration or driver’s license shall be renewed or issued to an obligor who fails to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child support proceedings after receiving notice, or to an obligor who is receiving income and who owes overdue child support in an amount equal to at least 60 days of support.  Notwithstanding any other law or regulation, a car registration or driver’s license that has been issued to an obligor who is receiving income and who owes overdue child support in an amount equal to at least 60 days of support payments shall be suspended.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Notwithstanding any other law or regulation, no professional, business, recreational, or sporting license shall be renewed or issued in the District to an obligor who fails to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child support proceedings after receiving notice, or to an obligor who is receiving income and who owes overdue child support in an amount equal to at least 60 days of support payments. Notwithstanding any other law or regulation, a professional, business, or recreational or sporting license that has been issued to an obligor who fails to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child support proceedings after receiving notice, or to an obligor who is receiving income and who owes overdue child support in an amount equal to at least 60 days of support payments, shall be suspended.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b-1)</span> As used in this section, the terms “professional license” and “business license” include any approval, certificate, registration, permit, statutory exemption, or other form of permission to practice a profession or trade, or to operate a business, as granted by a commission, agency, or a professional licensing body of the government of the District of Columbia.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b-2)</span> The obligor shall be entitled to an administrative hearing before the Mayor in accordance with procedures promulgated by the Mayor pursuant to the rulemaking provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 2, before any proposed denial, refusal to renew, or suspension of a license.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b-3)</span> Upon receipt of a notice from the Mayor that a license is subject to denial, refusal to renew, or suspension, the licensing agency shall, within 30 days, deny, refuse to renew, or suspend the license. The obligor may appeal the final decision of the Mayor to the Superior Court in accordance with the methods and standards of appeal set forth in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-509.html">2-509</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-510.html">2-510</a>.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor shall provide 30 days written notice to the obligor before denying issuance or renewal, or suspending the car registration or the driver’s, professional, business, recreational, or sporting license of an obligor pursuant to this section. The notice shall specify:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> That the obligor has the right to a hearing before the Mayor;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> How, when, and where the notice can be contested;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The amount owed, if any;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The date on which the obligor failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant, if applicable, and the nature of the obligor’s noncompliance;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> That the licensing authority shall deny issuance or renewal, or suspend the registration or license, 30 days after the issuance of a decision against the obligor by the Mayor following the hearing unless:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> An obligor who is receiving income and who owes overdue child support in an amount equal to at least 60 days of support pays the arrearage in full, or the obligor agrees to and complies with a payment schedule that requires the obligor to make monthly child support payments toward the overdue support in an amount equal to 25% of the obligor’s current monthly child support obligation for as long as the obligor is receiving income, subject to the limitations of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, approved May 29, 1968 (82 Stat. 146; 15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.). If the obligor fails to comply with the payment schedule after 30 days, but before the arrears are paid in full, denial or suspension shall take place immediately and without further notice;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> An obligor who has failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant related to paternity or child support proceedings, complies with all process required by the Superior Court or IV-D agency for 30 days; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> An obligor who is receiving income, owes at least 60 days of overdue child support, and has failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant related to paternity or child support proceedings complies with both subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> That the obligor shall not be entitled to an additional hearing or review regarding the denial or suspension of the license.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor shall provide the obligor with the opportunity to demonstrate why his or her registration or license should not be denied or suspended under this section. The only issues to be determined are as follows:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Whether the person named in the court notice is a licensee or applicant, has his or her car registered in the District of Columbia, and seeks to have a car registration issued or renewed;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Whether the arrearage has been paid in full, or whether a payment schedule has been agreed to and complied with, if the basis for denial or suspension is failure to pay overdue child support;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Whether the obligor is currently receiving income, if the basis for denial or suspension is failure to pay overdue child support;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3A)</span> Whether the obligor failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child support proceedings after receiving notice; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Whether the driver’s license or car registration or professional, business, recreational, or sporting license, should be suspended, or the issuance or renewal should be denied.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If the Clerk of the Court has notified the Mayor that an obligor has failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child support proceedings or that an obligor is receiving income and owes child support in an amount equal to at least 60 days of support, and the obligor presents no evidence under subsection (d) of this section that the obligor has complied with the terms described in subsection (c)(5) of this section, as applicable, the obligor’s license or registration shall be suspended, or the request for the issuance or renewal of the license or registration shall be denied.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> If the obligor under this subchapter is a member of the District of Columbia Bar, the Clerk of the Court shall send written notice to the Board of Professional Responsibility so that appropriate action may be taken.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> No liability shall be imposed on a licensing authority for refusing to renew, refusing to issue, or suspending a registration or license if the action is taken in response to a court or administrative order pursuant to this section.</p>
