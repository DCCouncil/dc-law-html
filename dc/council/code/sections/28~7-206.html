                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are held and any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of any charges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage fixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not less than 30 days after the warehouse gives notice. If the goods are not removed before the date specified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:7-210.html">§ 28:7-210</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in subsection (a) of this section and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:7-210.html">§ 28:7-210</a>, the warehouse may specify in the notice given under subsection (a) of this section any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not have notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse facilities, or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.</p>

                <p>“Warehouse”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Value”.  Section 1-204.</p>
                <p>“Reasonable time”.  Section 1-205.</p>
                <p>“Person”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Notification”.  Section 1-202.</p>
                <p>“Notice”.  Section 1-202.</p>
                <p>“Goods”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Good faith”.  Section 1-201 [7-102].</p>
                <p>“Document of title”.  Section 1-102.</p>
                <p><strong>Definitional Cross References:</strong> “Delivery”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p><strong>Cross References:</strong>Sections 7-103 and  7-403.</p>
                <p>4. The right to order removal of stored goods is subject to provisions of the public warehousing laws of some states forbidding warehouses from discriminating among customers. Nor does the section relieve the warehouse of any obligation under the state laws to secure the approval of a public official before disposing of deteriorating goods. Such regulatory statutes and the regulations under them remain in force and operative.  Section 7-103.</p>
                <p>3. Protection of its lien is the only interest which the warehouse has to justify summary sale of perishable goods which are not hazardous. This same interest must be recognized when the stored goods, although not perishable, decline in market value to a point which threatens the warehouse’s security.</p>
                <p>2. In permitting expeditious disposition of perishable and hazardous goods the pre-Code Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, Section 34, made no distinction between cases where the warehouse knowingly undertook to store such goods and cases where the goods were discovered to be of that character subsequent to storage. The former situation presents no such emergency as justifies the summary power of removal and sale. Subsections (b) and (c) distinguish between the two situations. The reason of this section should apply if the goods become hazardous during the course of storage. The process for selling the goods described in  Section 7-210 governs the sale of goods under this section except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) for the situations described in those subsections respectively.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes:</strong> 1. This section provides for three situations in which the warehouse may terminate storage for reasons other than enforcement of its lien as permitted by  Section 7-210. Most warehousing is for an indefinite term, the bailor being entitled to delivery on reasonable demand. It is necessary to define the warehouse’s power to terminate the bailment, since it would be commercially intolerable to allow warehouses to order removal of the goods on short notice. The thirty day period provided where the document does not carry its own period of termination corresponds to commercial practice of computing rates on a monthly basis. The right to terminate under subsection (a) includes a right to require payment of “any charges”, but does not depend on the existence of unpaid charges.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> Changes for style.</p>
                <p><strong>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</strong> Former  Section 7-206.</p>
                <p>“Warehouseman”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Value”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Reasonable time”.  Section 1-204.</p>

                <p>4. The right to order removal of stored goods is subject to provisions of the public warehousing laws of some states forbidding warehousemen from discriminating among customers. Nor does the section relieve the warehouseman of any obligation under the state laws to secure the approval of a public official before disposing of deteriorating goods. Such regulatory statutes and the regulations under them remain in force and operative.  Sections 7-103,  10-103.</p>
                <p>3. Protection of his lien is the only interest which the warehouseman has to justify summary sale of perishable goods which are not hazardous. This same interest must be recognized when the stored goods, although not perishable, decline in market value to a point which threatens the warehouseman’s security.</p>
                <p>2. In permitting expeditions disposition of perishable and hazardous goods Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, Section 34, made no distinction between cases where the warehouseman knowingly undertook to store such goods and cases where the goods were discovered to be of that character subsequent to storage. The former situation presents no such emergency as justifies the summary power of removal and sale. Subsections (2) and (3) distinguish between the two situations.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes of Changes:</strong> 1. Most warehousing is for an indefinite term, the bailor being entitled to delivery on reasonable demand. It is necessary to define the warehouseman’s power to terminate the bailment, since it would be commercially intolerable to allow warehousemen to order removal of the goods on short notice. The thirty day period provided where the document does not carry its own period of termination corresponds to commercial practice of computing rates on a monthly basis. The right to terminate under subsection (1) includes a right to require payment of “any charges”, but does not depend on the existence of unpaid charges.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> Rewritten and expanded to define the warehouseman’s right to terminate the storage not only where the goods are perishable or hazardous as in Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, Section 34, but also for any other reason including decline in value of the goods imperilling the warehouseman’s security for charges.</p>
