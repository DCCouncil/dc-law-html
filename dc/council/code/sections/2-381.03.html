If the District so requests, the District shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> When the qui tam plaintiff proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the qui tam plaintiff, may nevertheless permit the District to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Any payment to a qui tam plaintiff under this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds of the judgment or the settlement of the claim.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(A)">(A)</span> If the District does not proceed with an action brought by a qui tam plaintiff pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the qui tam plaintiff shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages; provided, that the amount shall be not less than 25%, and not more than 30%, of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Any payment to a qui tam plaintiff under this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds of the judgment or the settlement of the claim.

Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the District to continue the action, represented by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(5)">(5)</span> If the District does not proceed with the action and the qui tam plaintiff conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant reasonable attorneys fees and expenses necessarily incurred if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the qui tam plaintiff was frivolous, vexatious, or brought solely for purposes of harassment.</p>

If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the qui tam plaintiff shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the qui tam action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(6)(B)">(B)</span> For the purposes of this paragraph, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>
