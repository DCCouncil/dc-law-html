Each copy issued shall show the date of registration. A copy issued from records marked “delayed” or “amended” shall show the date of registration and the effective date. The documentary evidence used to establish a delayed certificate shall be shown on each copy issued. For purposes of this subsection the following rules apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The registrant, a member of his or her immediate family, his or her guardian, or their respective legal representatives shall be considered to have a direct and tangible interest.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> A certified copy provided under this subsection shall be restricted to the information contained in the pronouncement of death section and shall not include the facts of the medical cause or causes of death reported under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-211.html">7-211</a>(e) and (f) unless a qualified applicant having a direct and tangible interest in the death certificate makes a specific request for a certified copy of the medical certification of cause of death section, in which case the Registrar shall provide a separate certified copy of the medical certification of the cause of death section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> A certified copy of all or part of a vital record, issued in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, shall be considered for all purposes the same as the original and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the record. The evidentiary value of a certificate or record filed more than 1 year after the event or a record which has been amended shall be determined by the judicial or administrative body or official before whom the certificate is offered as evidence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The Registrar may supply copies or data from the system of vital records to the federal agency responsible for national vital statistics, as that agency may require for national statistics purposes, if the federal agency shares in the cost of collecting, processing, and transmitting such data. The data shall not  be used for other than statistical purposes by the federal agency without authorization from the Registrar.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Federal, state, District, and other public or private agencies may upon request be furnished copies or data from the system of vital records for statistical or administrative purposes upon such terms or conditions as may be prescribed by regulation.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The Registrar may, by agreement, transmit copies of records and other reports required by this chapter to offices of vital records outside the District, when such records or other reports relate to residents of those jurisdictions or persons born in those jurisdictions. The agreement shall require that the copies be used for statistical and administrative purposes only and provide for the retention and disposition of such copies. Copies received by the Registrar from offices of vital records in the states shall be handled in the same manner as prescribed in this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> No person shall prepare or issue any certificate which purports to be an original, certified copy, or copy of a vital record except as authorized in this chapter or regulations issued under this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the Registrar from providing:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> Information or data from the pronouncement of death and the medical certification of cause of death sections of the death certificate in accordance with §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-219.html">7-219</a>(b) and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-220.html">7-220</a>(c), (d), and (e); or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The Registrar shall disclose information contained in vital records, or copies of vital records, to the IV-D agency upon request, for purposes directly related to paternity establishment or the establishment, modification, or enforcement of a support order.</p>
