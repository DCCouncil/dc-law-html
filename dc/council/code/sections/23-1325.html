If such a risk of flight or danger is believed to exist, the person may be ordered detained. In any pretrial detention hearing under the provisions of this section, if the judicial officer finds that there is a substantial probability that the person has committed any of the foregoing offenses while armed with or having readily available a pistol, firearm, or imitation firearm, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that no condition or combination of conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of any other person or the community.</p>

Upon such finding, the judicial officer shall treat the person in accordance with the provisions of section 23-1321.</p>

Upon such findings, the judicial officer shall treat the person in accordance with the provisions of section 23-1321.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The provisions of section 23-1324 shall apply to persons detained in accordance with this section, except that the finding of the judicial officer that the appeal or petition for writ of certiorari does not raise by clear and convincing evidence a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in a reversal or order for new trial shall receive de novo consideration in the court in which review is sought.</p>
