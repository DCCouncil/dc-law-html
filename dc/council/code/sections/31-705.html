In the event of disallowance, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which shall be granted. The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this section if approval of the disclaimer has been granted by the Mayor or has been deemed approved.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k-1)</span> The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall also file an annual enterprise risk report.
