                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through verification of education, training, and experience and to ensure accountability for professional practice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day to day practice of telepsychology (that is, the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies) by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize state psychology regulatory authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Compact, to psychologists licensed in another state.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such state regulation will best protect public health and safety.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the home and receiving states.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice, it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> Whereas, consistent with these principles, this Compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)">(1)</span> Increase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for telepsychological practice across state lines as well as temporary in-person, face-to-face services in a state in which the psychologist is not licensed to practice psychology;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially client/patient safety;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(3)">(3)</span> Encourage the cooperation of compact states in the areas of psychology licensure and regulation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(4)">(4)</span> Facilitate the exchange of information between compact states regarding psychologist licensure, adverse actions, and disciplinary history;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(5)">(5)</span> Promote compliance with the laws governing psychological practice in each compact state; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(6)">(6)</span> Invest all compact states with the authority to hold licensed psychologists accountable through the mutual recognition of compact state licenses.</p>
