If the liquidator determines that there are insufficient assets to disburse, the application required by this section shall be considered satisfied by a filing by the liquidator stating the reasons for this determination.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The proposal required by subsection (a) of this section shall at least include provisions for:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Reserving amounts for the payment of expenses of administration and the payment of claims of secured creditors, to the extent of the value of the security held, and claims falling within the priorities established in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1340.html">31-1340</a>, classes 1 and 2;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Disbursement of the assets marshalled to date and subsequent disbursement of assets as they become available;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Equitable allocation of disbursements to each of the guaranty associations and foreign guaranty associations entitled thereto;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The securing by the liquidator, from each of the associations entitled to disbursements pursuant to this section, of an agreement to return to the liquidator those assets, together with income earned on assets previously disbursed, required to pay claims of secured creditors and claims falling within the priorities established in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1340.html">31-1340</a> in accordance with those priorities.
