The Mayor shall determine those instances in which the party or parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest in an insurer will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. The information shall remain confidential until the conclusion of the transaction unless the Mayor, in the Mayor’s discretion, determines that confidential treatment will interfere with enforcement of this subchapter. If the statement referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection is otherwise filed, this paragraph shall not apply.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(i)">(i)</span> After the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in the District or tend to create a monopoly. In applying the competitive standard in this sub-subparagraph:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(ii)(I)">(I)</span> The informational requirements of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-704.html">31-704</a>(c)(1) and the standards of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-704.html">31-704</a>(d)(2) shall apply;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(ii)(II)">(II)</span> The merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the Mayor finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-704.html">31-704</a>(d)(3) exist; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(ii)(III)">(III)</span> The Mayor may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(iii)">(iii)</span> The financial condition of any acquiring company is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(iv)">(iv)</span> The plans or proposals which the acquiring company has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer or are not in the public interest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(v)">(v)</span> The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)(vi)">(vi)</span> The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> The determination made by the Mayor as provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not become effective until 90 days after the Mayor makes the determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> The public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be held within 120 days after the statement required by subsections (a) and (b) of this section is filed, and at least 20-days notice shall be given by the Mayor to the person filing the statement; provided, that the Mayor may extend the 120-day period if all parties consent to the extension. Not less than 7-days notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to any other persons designated by the Mayor.  The Mayor shall make a determination within 120 days after the conclusion of the hearing; provided, that the Mayor may extend this period if all parties consent to the extension. At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, and any party shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments, and shall be entitled to conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than 3 days prior to the commencement of the public hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> The Mayor may retain, at the acquiring person’s expense, any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the Mayor’s staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the Mayor in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control. For this purpose, the Mayor shall be exempt from the provisions of Unit A of Chapter 3 of Title 2.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)">(4)</span><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(A)">(A)</span> If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section. A person shall file the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners within 5 days of making the request for a public hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(B)">(B)</span> A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within 10 days of the receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)(C)">(C)</span> A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The provisions of this section shall not apply to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)">(1)</span> Any transaction which is subject to the laws of the District dealing with the merger or consolidation of 2 or more insurers; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition which the Mayor by order shall exempt as:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.</p>
