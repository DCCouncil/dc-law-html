                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p>The 2015 amendment by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-36.html">D.C. Law 21-36</a>, in (a)(2), would have substituted “is authorized to acquire” for “shall acquire” and would have deleted “as described in the letter of intent between the District and Potomac Electric Power Company (“PEPCO”) dated December 27, 2013”; would have rewritten (d); and would have deleted “as described in the letter of intent between the District and PEPCO dated December 27, 2013” in (e).</p>
                <h4>Applicability</h4>
                <p>Applicability of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/20-233.html">D.C. Law 20-233</a>: Section 301 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/20-233.html">D.C. Law 20-233</a> provided (1) that the act shall apply upon the date of inclusions of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan; (2) that the Chief Financial Officer shall certify the date of the inclusion of the fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, and provide notice to the Budget Director of the Council of the certification; and (3) that the Budget Director shall cause the notice of the certification to be published in the District of Columbia Register and that the date of publication of the notice of the certification shall not affect the applicability of the act.</p>
                <p>Section 7010 of D.C. Law 22-33 repealed <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/20-233.html#§301">§ 301 of D.C. Law 20-233</a>. Therefore the creation of this section by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/20-233.html">D.C. Law 20-233</a> has been given effect.</p>
