The Mayor may waive, in whole or in part, interest and penalties, when, in his or her judgment, such waiver would be in the public interest.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> Any assessment pursuant to a determination of noncompliance shall be due and payable by March 31st following the end of the tax year in which the certificate of noncompliance was issued.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If BNA and BNAW are aggrieved by any assessment of accumulated real property tax, penalty, and interest on real property owned by BNA or BNAW covered by the Agreement and this section, BNA and BNAW may appeal from the assessment in the same manner and to the same extent as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-825.01.html">47-825.01</a> [repealed] and in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-3303.html">47-3303</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-3304.html">47-3304</a>; provided, however, that the deferred real property taxes need not first be paid.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> At the termination of the 10-year deferral period, BNA and BNAW shall be responsible for the payment of the deferred real property tax notwithstanding the pendency of any administrative or judicial challenge to a real property tax levy or assessment.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The Mayor is authorized to develop the necessary forms and procedures, and to promulgate regulations, necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
