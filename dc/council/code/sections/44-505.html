If the facility or agency fails to communicate, either orally or in writing, a timely request for a preliminary review hearing, the order of suspension or conversion shall remain in effect until terminated by the Mayor or an unexpedited hearing is held pursuant to procedures adopted under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/44-504.html">44-504</a>. Upon receipt of a timely request for an expedited, preliminary review hearing, the Mayor shall within 72 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) provide a hearing to review the reasonableness of the suspension or conversion order.

The suspension or conversion order shall be either affirmed or vacated at the hearing. In the event an order is affirmed, it shall, unless extended, remain in effect for no longer than 30 calendar days, during which time a final hearing shall be scheduled to consider the appropriateness of revocation or continuing restrictions on licensure. Before expiration of a suspension or conversion order, an extension may be granted for a period not to exceed an additional 30 calendar days upon agreement of all the parties or for good cause shown.</span>
