                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Staff responsible for administering the assessment shall receive specific training regarding the administration of the assessment and the follow-up services and programs available to eligible TANF recipients. Training shall include a focus on identifying barriers to employment, such as issues of domestic violence, mental health, and substance abuse.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span> As a condition of eligibility, all work-eligible TANF applicants shall complete an employment program orientation.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Has a child under 6 years of age and is not engaged in paid employment for at least 20 hours per week (or an average of 80 hours per month); or</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Mayor shall determine the nature and scope of the work activities that shall be required based on the person’s assessment; provided, that the Mayor shall not require the TANF recipient to participate in work activities for more than 35 hours per week.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> This subsection shall not apply to a TANF recipient who is exempt pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.19g.html">4-205.19g</a> or subject to the school-attendance requirements of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-205.65.html">4-205.65</a>.</p>

The Mayor shall determine the nature and scope of the activities based on the assessment. In no event shall the Mayor require the TANF recipient to participate in job search or job readiness activities for more hours than would be necessary for the combined number of hours of participation of both parents to equal 35 hours per week (or 55 hours per week, if the family receives federally-funded child care and no adult in the family has a disability, or caring for a child with a disability).</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor shall promulgate rules to:</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Refer such individuals to counseling and supportive services; and</p>
