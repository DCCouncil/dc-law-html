For the purposes of this subsection, the term “qualified military service” shall mean military service in the uniformed services (as defined in 38 U.S.C. § 43) by a member, if the member is entitled to reemployment rights with respect to such military service, all within the meaning of section 414(u)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
