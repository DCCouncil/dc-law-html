In construing and enforcing the provisions of this section, the act, omission, or failure of any officer, agent, or other person acting for or employed by any public utility acting within the scope of his employment and instructions shall in every case be deemed to be the act, omission, or failure of such public utility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Any person who violates any regulation issued by the Commission governing safety of pipeline facilities and the transportation of gas, shall be subject to a civil penalty as set forth in the Commission’s regulations, Title 15 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (15 DCMR), for each violation for each day that violation persists. Civil penalties established by the Commission shall not exceed maximum civil penalties established by federal laws and regulations governing the safety of pipeline facilities and the transportation of gas.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission may adjudicate the occurrence of a violation under this section and impose sanctions in accordance with its regulations. Any such civil penalty may be compromised by the Commission. In determining the amount of such penalty, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the gravity of the violation, and the good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation, shall be considered. The amount of such penalty when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the District of Columbia to the person charged or may be recovered in a civil action in the District of Columbia courts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> In connection with a proceeding under this section, a public utility shall provide to the Commission access to any accounts, books, papers, and documents which the Commission considers necessary to resolve the matter.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> In determining the amount of a penalty, the Commission may consider the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(A)">(A)</span> The public utility’s previous violations, including the following:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(B)">(B)</span> The gravity and duration of the current violation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(C)">(C)</span> The public utility’s good-faith attempt to achieve compliance with the regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> A penalty imposed under this subsection shall not be passed on to ratepayers in rates or in any other manner by the public utility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> The civil penalty set forth in this subsection shall apply only to regulations of the Public Service Commission designated as “reliability performance standards”.
