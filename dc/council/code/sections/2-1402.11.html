An accommodation would cause an employer undue hardship when it would cause the employer to incur more than de minimis costs.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> When an employee’s request for a particular form of accommodation would cause undue hardship to the employer, the employer shall reasonably accommodate the employee in a manner that does not cause undue hardship to the employer. Where other means of accommodation would cause undue hardship to the employer, an employee shall have the option of taking leave without pay if granting leave without pay would not cause undue hardship to the employer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> An employee shall notify the employer of the need for an accommodation at least 10 working days prior to the day or days for which the accommodation is needed, unless the need for the accommodation cannot reasonably be foreseen.</p>

The mere assumption that other employees with the same religious beliefs might also request accommodation shall not be considered evidence of undue hardship. An employer that employs 5 or fewer full-time employees shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection.</p>
