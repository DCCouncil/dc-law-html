                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> The Obligations issued under the provisions of this chapter do not constitute obligations of the District, but are payable solely from the revenues or assets of the Authority.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> Income from the Obligations issued by the Authority shall be exempt from District taxation, except that it shall remain subject to estate and gift taxation.</p>

The HFA shall include the amount requested in its request to the Mayor for tax-exempt bond volume cap allocation. To the extent that any allocation is received for an undertaking of the Authority, and remains unused for a period of 2 years, the HFA may allocate such amounts to other projects of the HFA.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(n)">(n)</span> The District warrants to the Authority, with regard to any and all Obligations issued by the Authority, and to the holders of such Obligations, that the District will not limit or alter rights vested in the Authority to fulfill agreements made with holders of the Obligations, nor in any way impair the rights and remedies available to the holders of the Obligations, until the Obligations and the interest thereon, together with interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceedings brought by or on behalf of the holders of the Obligations, have been fully met, paid, and discharged. The Authority is authorized to include this pledge of the District in any agreement with the holders of the Obligations.</p>
