The board of directors shall also transmit to the members a recommendation that the members approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances, it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors must transmit to the members the basis for that determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of merger or membership exchange to the members on any basis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> If the plan of merger or membership exchange is required to be approved by the members, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the nonprofit corporation shall give notice to each member entitled to vote on the merger or membership exchange of the meeting of members at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing corporation or eligible entity, the notice shall also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or organic records of that corporation or eligible entity. If the corporation is to be merged into a corporation or eligible entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or organic records of the new corporation or eligible entity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or the board of directors acting pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of the plan of merger or membership exchange by the members shall require the approval of the members at a meeting at which a quorum exists, and, if any class of memberships is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or membership exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> Separate voting by voting groups shall be required:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(7)">(7)</span> If as a result of a merger or membership exchange one or more members of a domestic nonprofit corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of merger or membership exchange shall require the signature, by each such member, of a separate record consenting to become subject to such owner liability.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(8)">(8)</span> If a domestic nonprofit corporation that is a party to a merger does not have any members entitled to vote thereon, a plan of merger shall be deemed adopted by the corporation when it has been adopted by the board of directors pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
