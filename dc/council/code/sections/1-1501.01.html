In addition, this Department maintains the District's public and metered parking facilities.The Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for testing and licensing operators of all powered wheeled vehicles, as well as for inspecting and registering these vehicles.The Transportation Systems Coordinator, lodged in the Executive office of the Mayor, provides liaison to the Metro operations, evaluates transportation proposals, and advises the Mayor on transportation policy.Each of the above entities provides specific services to the District based on valid and appropriate objectives. Taken collectively, however, these goals are not sufficiently broad to encompass the entire spectrum of District transportation needs. No single authority now exists which can perform an overview of city transportation needs and costs, balancing one mode against another or relating those needs and costs to non-transportation factors such as environmental impact and the broad economic situation.<em>plan to establish a district of columbia department of transportation</em>In order to deal more effectively with the broader issues relating to the overall transportation needs of District citizens and visitors, it is planned to combine into one organizational entity all related activities and functions now dispersed among the several offices cited above.The reorganization presented in Reorganization Plan 2, with associated charts and tables, has been prepared with three objectives in mind:<em>Objective One: Capability for Broad Over-View:</em> A Department of Transportation will be the key mechanism for addressing issues, needs and programs that extend to all transportation modes. The new department will identify rail service needs; perform analyses of the adequacy of the bus system and develop ways to improve it; develop plans and programs to integrate various methods of transportation to expedite passenger movement; promote the development of aviation facilities and their safe use; determine the need for new and perhaps larger transportation terminal facilities; develop the means for a more efficient distribution of goods; and develop a system of bikeways and pedestrianways. In summary, it will broaden the transportation objectives of the city.        
        <em>Objective Two: More Rational Allocation of Resources:</em> The new realignment of facilities and services should reflect a more balanced approach to the transportation system. At the same time, the realignment should permit the department to obtain a better assessment of the resources needed to operate a total system.        
        <em>Objective Three: Active Coordination with Independent Transportation Modes and with other Jurisdictions:</em> While the city does not operate the METRO system or taxi companies, the city does have a responsibility to require that these transportation services be adequate, safe and economical. A Department of Transportation will provide the focal point for the city to interact with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the taxi industry, and other owners and regulators of transportation services.        
        <em>structure and functions of the new department</em>The Functional Chart of the planned Department carries out these objectives in structural form. Eight subunits are planned; three at the staff level, four at the operating level, and an Office of the Director. Notes on each of the eight units follow:<em>Office of the Director:</em> In addition to a Director and Deputy Director, a staff for community relations is being established. The great importance of two-way communication with the community (both residents and visitors to the Nation's Capital) has led to the decision to give this function direct access to the Head of the agency by placing it in his immediate Office.        
        <em>Office of Administration:</em> The Administrative functions of the two existing departments are consolidated in this Unit. In addition to the present functions, financial resources management and regulations/legislation have been added here. The goal of financial resources management is to inventory and control all department resources within the context of one overall plan and budget. In order to permit analysis of departmental regulations, Federal requirements, and staff-level review of departmental hearing processes, a unit of regulations and legislation is also proposed.        
        <em>Office of Transportation Policy and Plans:</em> Overall program priorities will be developed here for recommendation to the Director and, through the Director, to the Mayor and Council. The economic impact of transportation decisions has long been neglected, but will find a home in this Office. Systems planning for all modes of transportation will be established to reflect general policy objectives. Traditional project oriented planning such as is now performed in the Highways and Traffic Department will take its cue and direction from the systems planning staff. Finally, establishment of a social program analytical capability will provide a planning link to community transportation needs.        
        <em>Office of Safety and Environment:</em> The existing highway safety coordination and safety education functions currently in the DMV form the nucleus for this new Office. This organization will allow for a new emphasis on safety standards for additional transport modes and for expansion of the environmental programs, including social impact and interagency cooperation.        
        The four operating bureaus, now identified as the Bureaus of Design, Engineering and Research, Construction and Maintenance, Traffic Engineering and Operations, and Motor Vehicle Services, are based on the present operating responsibilities of the Highways and Traffic and Motor Vehicle Departments. A side benefit to be gained, however, is that better resource utilization can be made possible through implementation of intermodal transportation projects at the operating level.<em>expected benefits of the creation of the department of transportation</em><em>Short-range:</em><strong>1.</strong> Provides a central focal point within the District to deal with issues affecting overall municipal, area, and regional transportation planning.
        <strong>2.</strong> Provides unified direction over all related activities in setting and achieving District-wide transportation goals, through closer coordination of the various facets of operations and programs.
        <strong>3.</strong> Permits the expansion of technical and professional planning capability at the operating level without added expense to the District.
        <strong>4.</strong> Permits greater flexibility for applying available resources appropriately to meet program and project priority needs.
        <strong>5.</strong> Creates a more effective use of available professional, technical, and administrative staff skills through the expanded planning and resource flexibility capability.
        <em>Long-range:</em><strong>1.</strong> Permits acquisition of additional and more suitable skills needed, through the normal process of employee turnover, for dealing with present day long-range transportation issues.
        <strong>2.</strong> Permits anticipated administrative efficiencies and economies, particularly in the areas of personnel, budget, office services, procurement, and administrative management, through the consolidation of existing administrative staffs and elimination of hierarchical structures now necessary for each of the existing independent agencies.
