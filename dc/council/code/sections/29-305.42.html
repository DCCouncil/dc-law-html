                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> Transfers to one or more shareholders or other persons all or part of the authority to exercise the corporate powers or to manage the activities and affairs of the corporation, including the resolution of any issue about which there exists a deadlock among directors or shareholders;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> Requires dissolution of the corporation at the request of one or more of the shareholders or upon the occurrence of a specified event or contingency; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all persons that are shareholders at the time of the agreement; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(B)">(B)</span> A written agreement that is signed by all persons that are shareholders at the time of the agreement and is made known to the corporation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Subject to amendment only by all persons that are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Valid for 10 years, unless the agreement provides otherwise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement required by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-304.26.html#(b)">§ 29-304.26(b)</a>. If, at the time of the agreement, the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Any purchaser of shares that, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement may rescind the purchase. A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares. An action to enforce the right of rescission authorized by this subsection shall be commenced within the earlier of 90 days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or 2 years after the time of purchase of the shares.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors relieves the directors of, and imposes upon the person or persons in which the discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made.</p>
