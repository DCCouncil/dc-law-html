                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The Council of the District of Columbia is authorized and empowered to classify dealers in secondhand personal property (referred to in this section as “dealers”) and the Mayor of the District of Columbia is authorized and empowered to fix and collect a license fee for each such class of dealer, which fee, in the judgment of the Mayor, will be commensurate with the cost to the District of Columbia of inspection, supervision, and regulation of such class of dealer.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> In classifying dealers the Council may take into consideration the kind of property dealt in, whether the property is retained by the dealer for sale at retail, whether the property is disposed of by the dealer out of the District of Columbia, whether the property is disposed of by the dealer as junk or otherwise, and such other criteria as the Council may deem appropriate.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Any person engaging in the business of buying, selling, trading, exchanging, or dealing in secondhand personal property of any description, including the return of unused portion of any ticket, order, or token purporting to evidence the right of the holder or possessor thereof to be transported by any railroad or other common carrier, however operated, from one state or territory of the United States, or from the District of Columbia, to any other state or territory of the United States or to the District of Columbia, shall be regarded as a dealer, and shall obtain the appropriate license and pay the fee therefor fixed by the Mayor. For the purposes of this section, the term “secondhand personal property” shall not include any item of personal property:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Which the possessor thereof has acquired as part payment or allowance on the sale by such possessor of a new or rebuilt item of personal property;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Which the possessor thereof has acquired by reason of its return to him for credit, refund, or exchange by a person having purchased such item from such possessor; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Which is offered for sale, trade, or exchange by the person who repossesses the same.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> [Repealed].</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Any license issued pursuant to this section for Class A and Class C shall be issued as an Inspected Sales and Services endorsement to a basic business license under the basic business license system as set forth in subchapter I-A of this chapter. Any other license issued pursuant to this section shall be issued as a General Sales endorsement to a basic business license.</p>
