                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/14-28.html">D.C. Law 14-28</a> substituted “ABRA Fund” for “ABRA Account” in subsec. (b); and rewrote subsec.

Any monies deposited in the ABRA Account but not expended in a fiscal year shall be returned to the General Fund. Subject to the applicable laws relating to the appropriation of District funds, monies received and credited to the ABRA Account shall be used to fund the expenses of ABRA in the discharge of its administrative and regulatory duties. Funds obtained from penalties and fines, as prescribed by Chapter 8, shall be credited to the General Fund.”</p>
