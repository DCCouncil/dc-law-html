                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Transportation such amounts as may be necessary to enable him to discharge his responsibilities under guarantees issued by him under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1111.06.html">9-1111.06</a> and to make the payments to the Transit Authority in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1111.12.html">9-1111.12</a>. Amounts appropriated under this section shall be available without fiscal year limitation.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> If at any time the moneys available to the Secretary of Transportation are insufficient to enable him to discharge his responsibilities under guarantees issued by him under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1111.06.html">9-1111.06</a> or to make payments to the Transit Authority in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1111.12.html">9-1111.12</a>, he shall issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Redemption of such notes or obligations shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation from appropriations available under subsection (a) of this section. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any notes or other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that Act are extended to include any purchase of such notes or obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
