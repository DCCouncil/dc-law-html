                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Board shall recount the votes cast in one or more voting precincts, if, within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election for an office, a candidate for that office petitions the Board in writing and specifies the precincts in which the recount shall be conducted. Before beginning the recount, the Board shall prepare an estimate of the costs and inform the petitioner of the anticipated number of hours needed to complete the recount and the cost per hour. The costs of the recount shall not include any payments associated for salaried election officials. If the petitioner chooses to proceed with the recount, the petitioner shall deposit the amount of $50 per precinct included in the recount. If the result of the election is changed as a result of the recount, the deposit shall be refunded. If the result is not changed, the Board shall determine the actual cost of the recount. The petitioner shall be liable for the actual cost of the recount and the Board may collect that cost from the deposit made with the petition.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If in any election for President and Vice President of the United States, Delegate to the House of Representatives, Chairman of the Council, member of the Council, Mayor, Attorney General, or member of the State Board of Education, the results certified by the Board show a margin of victory for a candidate that is less than one percent of the total votes cast for the office, the Board shall conduct a recount. The cost of a recount conducted pursuant to this paragraph shall not be charged to any candidate.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> In the case of an initiative or referendum measure placed on the ballot pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.16.html">1-1001.16</a>, or a recall measure placed on the ballot pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.17.html">1-1001.17</a>, the Board shall conduct a recount if the difference between the number of votes for and against the initiative, referendum, or recall measure is less than one percent of the total votes cast.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The Board shall issue regulations prescribing the procedures for the Board to:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Provide notice of a recount to candidates for an office subject to a recount;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Conduct a recount and certify the official result of an election, initiative, referendum, or recall measure which is the subject of the recount; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Ensure that each candidate for an office subject to a recount may designate watchers to be present while the recount is conducted, or in the case of an initiative, referendum, or recall measure, ensure that members of the public may be present while the recount is conducted.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election, any person who voted in the election may petition the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to review the election. The Court’s authority to review the results of an election shall include initiative, referendum, and recall measures as well as elections for a particular office.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In response to such a petition, the Court may set aside the results certified and declare the true results of the election, or void the election in whole or in part. To determine the true results of an election, the Court may order a recount or take other appropriate action, whether or not a recount has been conducted or requested pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The Court shall void an election only if it:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Determines that the candidate certified as the winner of the election does not meet the qualifications required for office; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Finds that there was any act or omission, including fraud, misconduct, or mistake serious enough to vitiate the election as a fair expression of the will of the registered qualified electors voting in the election.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the Court voids an election, it may order a special election, which shall be conducted in such a manner, and at such time, as the Board may prescribe.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The decision of the Court in any case brought pursuant to this subsection shall be final and may not be appealed.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The Court shall have the authority to require the losing party to reimburse the prevailing party for reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with the case, but shall not exercise this authority if it finds that the reimbursement would impose an undue financial hardship on the losing party.</p>
