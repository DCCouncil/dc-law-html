                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>1981 Ed., § 28:2A-310.</p>
                <h4>Section References</h4>
                <p>This section is referenced in § 28:2A-103.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Uniform Statutory Source:</strong>Section 9-314.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> Revised to reflect leasing terminology and to add new material.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes:</strong> Subsections (1) and (2) restate the provisions of subsection (1) of  Section 9-314 to clarify the definition of accession and to add leasing terminology to the priority rule that applies when the lease is entered into before the goods become accessions.</p>
                <p>Subsection (3) restates the provisions of subsection (2) of  Section 9-314 to add leasing terminology to the priority rule that applies when the lease is entered into on or after the goods become accessions. Unlike the rule with respect to security interests, the lease is merely subordinate, not invalid.</p>
                <p>Subsection (4) creates two exceptions to the priority rules stated in subsections (2) and (3). Subsection (4) deletes the special priority rule found in the provisions of  Section 9-314(3)(b) as the interests of the lessor and lessee are entitled to greater protection.</p>
                <p>Finally, subsection (5) is modeled on the provisions of  Section 9-314(4) with respect to removal of accessions, restated to reflect the parallel changes in Section 2A-309(8).</p>
                <p>Neither this section nor  Section 9-314 governs where the accession to the goods is not subject to the interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract and is not subject to the interest of a secured party under a security agreement. This issue is to be resolved by the courts, case by case.</p>
