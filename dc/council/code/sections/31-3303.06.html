Participation in such plan shall be made available to all the eligible employees of a covered small employer and their dependents. No coverage may be offered to only certain eligible employees or their dependents and no employees or their dependents may be excluded or charged additional premiums because of health status.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> No coverage offered under this subchapter shall exclude an employer based solely on the nature of the employer’s business.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurer if such coverage is made available in the small group market only through one or more bona fide associations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> A health insurer that offers health insurance coverage in a small group market through a network plan may:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> Limit the employees that may apply for such coverage to those eligible individuals who live, work, or reside in the service area for such network plan; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> Within the service area of such plan, deny such coverage to such employers if the health insurer has demonstrated, if required, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(A)">(A)</span> It will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to enrollees of any additional groups because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(B)">(B)</span> It is applying this subdivision uniformly to all employers without regard to the claims experience of those employers and their employees (and their dependents) or any health status-related factors relating to such employees and dependents.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> It is applying this subdivision uniformly to all employers in the small group market in the District of Columbia consistent with the laws of this District of Columbia and without regard to the claims experience of those employers and their employees (and their dependents) or any health status-related factor relating to such employees and dependents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> No health insurer offering group health insurance coverage is required to offer coverage or accept applications pursuant to subsection (a) of this section if the Commissioner determines that acceptance of an application or applications would result in the health insurer being declared an impaired insurer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> A health insurer offering group health insurance coverage that does not offer coverage pursuant to subsection (f) of this section may not offer coverage to small employers until the Commissioner determines that the health insurer is no longer impaired.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(3)">(3)</span> Any employer contribution rule or group participation rule shall be applied uniformly among small employers without reference to the size of the small employer group, health status of the small employer group, or other factors.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(B)">(B)</span> To an employee where the employee does not reside or work within the health maintenance organization’s approved service areas; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Within an area where the health maintenance organization demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that it will not have the capacity within that area and its network of providers to deliver services adequately to the enrollees of those groups because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(3)">(3)</span> A health maintenance organization that does not offer coverage pursuant to this subsection may not offer coverage in the applicable area to new employer groups with more than 50 eligible employees until the later of 180 days after closure to new applications or the date on which the carrier health maintenance organization notifies the Commissioner that it has regained capacity to deliver services to small employers.</p>
