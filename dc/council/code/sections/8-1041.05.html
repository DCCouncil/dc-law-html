                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)(B)">(B)</span> Public outreach and awareness activities to District residents through the representative organization's website and other means to ensure that District residents are aware of the availability and location of collection sites and events; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> For the purposes of calculating a manufacturer or partnership's achievement of its minimum collection share as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the manufacturer or partnership may count the collection of a single item of covered electronic equipment as twice its weight when that item is donated free of charge for reuse to the District's public or charter schools, to public or charter schools in counties adjoining the District, or to any nonprofit organization with a principal mission of assisting low-income children or families. To qualify for this credit, the covered electronic equipment must be no more than 3 years old, in full working condition, and accepted in writing by the recipient as a donation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> The Mayor may grant a one-year waiver, in whole or in part, from the minimum collection standards, where a manufacturer not participating in a partnership or representative organization has demonstrated that the standard could not be met despite best efforts because the manufacturer has substantially increased the amount of covered electronic equipment sold within the District over the 3-year period during which compliance with the minimum collection standard is to be calculated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Beginning January 1, 2017, a manufacturer shall accept, on a one-to-one basis with the purchase of the same type of covered electronic equipment, covered electronic equipment that is offered for return by a person in the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Beginning January 1, 2018, a manufacturer or retailer shall provide at the point of sale information on how a person can return purchased covered electronic equipment for recycling.</p>
