Pursuant to Section 14a(a) of the Cable Television Communications Act of 1981, effective October 22, 1983 (<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/4-142.html">D.C. Law 4-142</a>;  D.C. Code, sec. 34-1213.01(a)), District Cablevision, Inc., a corporation with its principal place of business located within the District of Columbia, is granted of itself, its successors, and assigns a revocable right to construct, reconstruct, operate, and maintain for a 15-year period from the effective date of this act, a cable television system within the entirety of the District of Columbia, subject to the terms, conditions, and requirements specified in the Franchise Agreement (“Agreement”) and the laws and regulations of the District of Columbia and the United States applicable to cable television franchises, facilities, and services.
