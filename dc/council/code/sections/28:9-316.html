                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within 4 months after, the new debtor becomes bound under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:9-203.html">28:9-203</a>(d), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral had the collateral been acquired by the original debtor.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A security interest perfected by the financing statement and which becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:9-301.html">28:9-301</a>(1) or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:9-305.html">28:9-305</a>(c) or the expiration of the 4-month period remains perfected thereafter.
