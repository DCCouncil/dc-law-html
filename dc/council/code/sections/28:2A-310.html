                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract described in subsection (b) or (c) of this section is subordinate to the interest of:</p>

A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.</p>
