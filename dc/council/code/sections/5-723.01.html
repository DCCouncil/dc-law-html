In addition to the foregoing, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to the remainder of this subsection, the maximum annual additions for any limitation year shall be equal to the lesser of:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> The dollar limit on annual additions; or</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> 100% of the member’s remuneration.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The defined benefit dollar limit and the dollar limit on annual additions shall be adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The dollar limit as adjusted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies, but a member’s benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit before January 1 of that calendar year. To the extent that the monthly benefit payable to a member who has reached the member’s termination date is limited by the application of this subsection, the limit shall be adjusted to reflect subsequent adjustments made in accordance with section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, but the adjusted limit shall apply only to benefits payable on or after January 1 of the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Benefits shall be actuarially adjusted based upon the defined benefit dollar limit, as follows:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> There shall be an adjustment for benefits payable in a form other than a straight life annuity as follows:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If a monthly benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, before applying the defined benefit dollar limit, the benefit shall be adjusted in the manner described in sub-subparagraphs (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, to the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that begins at the same time. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for:</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> Benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits, such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits; or</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> In the case of a form of benefit not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the inclusion of a feature under which a benefit increases automatically to the extent permitted to reflect cost-of-living adjustments and the increase, if any, in the defined benefit dollar limit under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> If the benefit of a member is paid in a form not subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity, without regard to cost-of-living adjustments described in this subsection, is equal to the greater of:</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity, if any, payable to the member commencing at the same time; or</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> If the benefit of a member is paid in a form subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greatest of:</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity having a commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the definition of actuarial equivalent for adjusting benefits in the same form;</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the time that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using a 5.5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(III)</span> The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the member’s form of benefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, divided by 1.05.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iv)</span> For the purposes of this subparagraph, whether a form of benefit is subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code is determined without regard to the status of this subchapter as a governmental plan as described in section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> There shall be an adjustment to benefits that commence before age 62 or after age 65 as follows:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> If the benefit of a member begins before age 62, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at the earlier age shall be an annual benefit payable in the form a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at age 62 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However, if the benefit provided under this subchapter provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. The adjustment in this sub-subparagraph shall not apply as a result of benefits paid on account of disability under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-709.html">5-709</a> or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-710.html">5-710</a> or as a result of the death of a member under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-716.html">5-716</a>. Notwithstanding the provisions above, a member that qualifies under section 415(b)(2(G) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is not subject to the adjustment to benefits that commence before age 62.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> If the benefit of a member begins after age 65, the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the defined benefit dollar limit applicable at age 65 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10 years, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this subchapter provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> The limitation determined under the immediately preceding sentence; or</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for participation of less than 10 years, if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at the age of benefit commencement to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at the age the benefit commences is the annual amount of the annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member’s accruals after age 65 but including any actuarial adjustments, even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this subchapter at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under this subchapter to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same annuity as the member.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> For the purposes of this subparagraph, no adjustment shall be made to the defined benefit dollar limit to reflect the probability of a member’s death between the commencing date and age 62, or between age 65 and the commencing date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member before the annuity having a commencing date. To the extent that benefits are forfeited upon death before the date the benefits first commence, an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member’s death if the benefit provided under this subchapter does not charge the member for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, upon the member’s death.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the member has fewer than 10 years of participation in the defined benefit portion of this subchapter, as determined under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations thereunder, the defined benefit dollar limit shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation under this subchapter and the denominator of which is 10. The adjustment in this paragraph shall not apply to benefits paid on account of disability under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-709.html">5-709</a> or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-710.html">5-710</a> or as a result of the death of a member under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-716.html">5-716</a>. In the case of years of credited service credited to a member pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-704.html">5-704</a>:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The limitations contained in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection and this paragraph shall not apply to the portion of the member’s accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-704.html">5-704</a> that are actuarially funded by:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> A transfer or rollover from the member’s account under a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or from an individual retirement account; or</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> A direct payment.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The limitations contained in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection and this paragraph shall apply to the portion of the member’s accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-704.html">5-704</a> that are not actuarially funded by:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> A transfer or rollover from the member’s account under a retirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or from an individual retirement account; or</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> A direct payment.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The determination of the extent to which additional years of credited service under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-704.html">5-704</a> have been actuarially funded as of the annuity commencement date shall be determined in accordance with section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (using the actuarial assumptions thereunder), applied as if section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applied and treating the amount transferred from a plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the member’s account under an eligible deferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or an individual retirement account, or the amount of the direct lump-sum payment to the Custodian of Retirement Funds, as if it were a mandatory employee contribution.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> In addition to the foregoing, the maximum benefit and contributions shall be reduced, and the rate of benefit accrual shall be frozen or reduced accordingly, to the extent necessary to prevent disqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with respect to a member who is also a participant in:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Another tax-qualified retirement plan maintained by the District, including a defined benefit plan in which an individual medical benefit account as described in section 415(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has been established for the member;</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A welfare plan maintained by the District in which a separate account, as described in section 419A(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, has been established to provide post-retirement medical benefits for the member;
