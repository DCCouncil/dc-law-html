In addition to the preliminary tax roll, the BID shall also provide supporting information which describes the information relied upon by the BID in preparing the preliminary tax roll. The supporting information shall be based on information provided to the BID by the Office of Taxation and Revenue and any other reliable source. The preliminary BID tax roll and the supporting information shall be prepared in such form as may be prescribed by regulation by the CFO. In the event that a BID fails to provide the preliminary BID tax roll and the supporting information within the time period specified by this subsection, the BID taxes shall be collected at the time of the next regularly scheduled tax bill.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> During a control year, the CFO, and in any other year, the Mayor shall examine the preliminary BID tax roll and backup information and shall make any changes it deems are required by this subchapter. During a control year, the CFO, and in any other year, the Mayor, shall certify a final BID tax roll no later than 30 days prior to the billing dates described in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, BID taxes shall be collected by the CFO during a control year, and by the Mayor in any other year. Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, BID taxes shall be collected in the same manner as real property taxes are collected. The CFO during a control year, and the Mayor in any other year, may contract with a financial institution having assets in excess of $50 million or a BID (if the BID tax is related to such BID) to perform services for the District in connection with the collection and distribution of BID taxes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> BID taxes shall be effective as of the date a BID is registered or deemed registered by the Mayor pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-1215.06.html">2-1215.06</a>, except for BID taxes that become effective pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-1215.04.html">2-1215.04</a>(f) or (g). Any changes to the BID tax adopted pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-1215.08.html">2-1215.08</a> shall be effective as of the first day of the subsequent fiscal year.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> BID taxes shall be due and payable semiannually in 2 equal installments, the first being paid on or before September 15 preceding the real property tax year for the period October 1 through March 31, and the second installment to be paid on or before March 31 of the real property tax year for the period April 1 through September 30.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> BID taxes for the period of time between the effective date of a BID’s registration and the last day of the applicable 6-month period shall be collected through a special bill, if the relevant BID application requests such a special bill, to be mailed by the District or its contractee within 30 days of the effective date of the BID tax with such special bill due for payment 45 days from the date of such special bill, or if the BID application does not request such a special bill, the BID taxes for such period of time shall be billed at the time of the next practicable regularly scheduled property tax bill pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, along with any other BID taxes collectible at the time of such billing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> If at any time after the dates provided by subsection (e) of this section any BID tax is not paid within the time prescribed, there shall be added to the BID tax a penalty of 10% of the unpaid amount plus simple interest on the unpaid amount at the rate of 1.5% per month or portion of a month until the BID tax is paid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> If any BID tax shall remain unpaid after the expiration of 60 days from the date such tax became due, the property subject to such BID tax may be sold at the next ensuing tax sale in the same manner and under the same conditions as property sold for delinquent real property taxes, if such BID taxes with interest and penalties thereon shall not have been paid in full prior to said sale. If an accounting is made in accordance with, and subject to, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1340.html">47-1340</a>(f), of the District of Columbia Code, the proceeds from such sale shall be applied towards such delinquent BID taxes together with interest and penalties thereon, including costs associated with such sale; provided, that the proceeds from such sale shall be applied first to any delinquent real property taxes (and penalties and costs associated therewith), and then, to the extent a required accounting is made in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1340.html">47-1340</a>(f), in the following order of priority: any delinquent water and sewer charges; any lien for tenant relocation expenses under <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-3531.16.html">§ 42-3531.16</a>; and any delinquent litter control nuisance fines, in accordance, respectively, with §§ 47-1303.4 [47-1303.04], 34-2407.02, 34-211, and 8-807. The proceeds shall then be applied towards any other delinquent tax, aside from the BID tax, owed by the owner of such property. The proceeds due for such delinquent BID taxes with interest and penalties thereon shall then be delivered to the collection agent for deposit into the relevant special account within 30 business days of its receipt by the District or the BID pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-1215.17.html">2-1215.17</a>.</p>
