                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The laws of the state in which the regional bank holding company making the acquisition has its principal place of business permit the regional bank holding company to be acquired by the District of Columbia bank holding company or the District of Columbia bank sought to be acquired.</p>

A regional bank holding company may acquire all or substantially all of the shares of a bank organized solely for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition of a bank that has been in existence and continuously operating as a bank for more than 2 years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The acquisition complies with any conditions, restrictions, requirements, or other limitations that would apply to the acquisition by the District of Columbia bank holding company or the District of Columbia bank sought to be acquired of a bank or bank holding company located in the state where the regional bank holding company making the acquisition has its principal place of business, but that would not apply to the acquisition of a bank or bank holding company in the state by a bank holding company, all the bank subsidiaries of which are located in that state.</p>
