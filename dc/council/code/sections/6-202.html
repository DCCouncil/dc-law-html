                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> There is established, as an independent authority of the District government, the District of Columbia Housing Authority. The Authority shall be a corporate body, intended, created, and empowered to effectuate the purposes stated in this chapter, and shall have  a legal existence separate from the District government. The Authority shall be the successor in interest to the housing authority created by subchapter II of Chapter 2 of Title 6 [repealed]. All real and personal property, assets, records, and obligations, and all unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds available or to be made available relating to the powers, duties, functions, operations, and administration of the DPAH and of the authority created under subchapter II of Chapter 2 of Title 6 shall become the property of the Authority on May 9, 2000, without further action.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Authority shall govern public housing and implement the Housing Act of 1937 in the District, and shall be responsible for providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings, and related facilities, for persons and families of low-and moderate-income in the District.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> There is established the District of Columbia Housing Authority Fund, which shall be a proprietary fund in the nature of an enterprise fund as classified under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/">47-373</a> and administered by the Authority in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All revenues, rents, proceeds, and monies, from whatever source derived, that are collected or received by the Authority shall be credited to the Fund and shall not at any time be transferred to, lapse into, or be commingled with the General Fund of the District or any other fund or account of the District; provided, that funds may be paid out of the Fund to the District Treasurer to pay for goods, services, or property, or other things of value, if any, purchased by the Authority from the District.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, or any other provision of this chapter, any funds provided to the Authority from the local revenues of the District shall be held separate and apart from the Fund and shall be held and expended for the use and benefit of the District for the purposes and uses provided in the approved budget and financial plan. The Authority shall expend, and account for the expenditure of, funds in the same manner as all other agencies of the District government. At the end of each fiscal year, the unexpended amount of such funds shall revert to the fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia.</p>
