                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/14-155.html">D.C. Law 14-155</a> rewrote subsec. (a); in subsec. (e)(1), substituted “Except as provided in paragraphs (2) through (5) of this subsection and subsection (f)(1) of this section,” for “Except as provided in paragraphs (2) through (4) of this subsection,”; and added subsecs. (e)(5) and (f). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/15-354.html">D.C. Law 15-354</a> substituted “Attorney General for the District of Columbia” for “Corporation Counsel”; and, in subsec. (e)(2), substituted “Administrative Law Judge” for “hearing examiner” and “any orders” for “any orders of the District of Columbia Board of Appeals and Review or”.</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/16-191.html">D.C. Law 16-191</a>, in subsec. (f)(2), validated a previously made technical correction.</p>
                <h4>Emergency Legislation</h4>
                <p>For temporary (90-day) amendment of section, see § 2 of the Health Care and Community Residence Facility Hospice and Home Care Licensure Penalties Emergency Amendment Act of 2000 (D.C. Act 13-546, January 11, 2001,  48 DCR 770).</p>
                <p>For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 2 of Health Care and Community Residence Facility, Hospice and Home Care Licensure Penalties Emergency Amendment Act of 2001 (D.C. Act 14-175, November 19, 2001,  48 DCR 11053).</p>
                <p>For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 2 of Health Care and Community Residence Facility, Hospice and Home Care Licensure Penalties Congressional Review Emergency Amendment Act of 2002 (D.C. Act 14-294, February 25, 2002,  49 DCR 2532).</p>
                <h4>Temporary Legislation</h4>
                <p>For temporary (225 day) amendment of section, see § 2 of Health Care and Community Residence Facility, Hospice and Home Care Licensure Penalties Temporary Amendment Act of 2000 (D.C. Law 13-271, April 4, 2001, law notification  48 DCR 3605).</p>

                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Because of the enactment of subchapter II of this chapter by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/12-238.html">D.C. Law 12-238</a> and the designation of the preexisting text as subchapter I, “subchapter” has been substituted for “act” twice in the first sentence of (a), twice in (e)(5), and five times in (f) and for “chapter” twice near the end of (b), in (c) and twice in (e)(1).</p>
