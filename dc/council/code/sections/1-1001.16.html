The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall expedite consideration of the matter. If the Superior Court of the District of Columbia determines that the issue presented by the measure is a proper subject of initiative or referendum, whichever is applicable, under the terms of title IV of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, and that the measure is legal in form, does not authorize discrimination as prescribed in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, and would not negate or limit an act of the Council of the District of Columbia as prescribed in paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection, it shall issue an order requiring the Board to accept the measure.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Prepare a short title for the measure consisting of not more than 15 words to permit the voters to identify readily the initiative or referendum measure and to distinguish it from other measures which may appear on the ballot; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Prepare, in the proper legislative form, the proposed initiative or referendum measure, where applicable, which shall conform to the legislative drafting format of acts of the Council of the District of Columbia.

Thereafter, such short title shall be the title of the measure in all petitions, ballots, and other proceedings relating thereto. The Board shall, upon the request of any person, make single copies of the approved short title, summary statement, and full legislative text available at no charge. Additional copies shall be made available at a nominal cost.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Upon final establishment of the summary statement, short title, and legislative form of an initiative or referendum proposal, the Board shall prepare and provide to the proposer at a public meeting an original petition form which the proposer shall formally adopt as his or her own form.

The number of registered electors which is used for computing these requirements shall be consistent with the latest official count of registered electors made by the Board 30 days prior to the initial submission to the Board of the initiative or referendum measure, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> A proposer of an initiative measure shall have 180 calendar days, beginning on the 1st calendar day immediately following the date upon which the Board certifies, according to subsection (h) [subsection (f)] of this section, that the petition form of such initiative measure is in its final form to secure the proper number of valid signatures needed on the initiative petition to qualify such a measure for the ballot, pursuant to subsection (i) of this section and to file such petition with the Board.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> A proposer of a referendum measure shall secure the proper number of valid signatures needed on the referendum petition to qualify such a measure for the ballot pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, and shall file such petition with the Board before the act, or part thereof, which is the subject of the referendum has become law according to the provisions of §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-204.04.html">1-204.04</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-206.02.html">1-206.02</a>(c).

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(3)">(3)</span> The proposer may not begin circulating an initiative or referendum petition until the Board has certified pursuant to subsection (h) [subsection (f)] of this section that such petition is in its final form.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)">(1)</span> Upon submission of an initiative or referendum petition by the proposer to the Board, the Board shall refuse to accept the petition upon any of the following grounds:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)(D)">(D)</span> The petition sheets do not have attached to them the statements of the circulators as provided in subsection (h) of this section; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)(E)">(E)</span> The petition was circulated by persons who were not qualified petition circulators at the time of circulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)">(2)</span> In the case of refusal to accept a petition, the Board shall endorse on the petition the words “submitted but not accepted” and the date, and retain the petition pending appeal. If none of the grounds for refusal exists, the Board shall accept the petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> If the Board refuses to accept an initiative or referendum petition when submitted to it, the person or persons submitting such petition may apply, within 10 days after the Board’s refusal to accept such petition, to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for a writ in the nature of mandamus to compel the Board to accept such petition. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall expedite the consideration of the matter. If the Superior Court of the District of Columbia determines that the petition is legal in form and apparently meets the requirement for signatures, both as to number and as to ward distribution, prescribed in subsection (i) of this section, and was submitted within the time limitations established in subsection (j) of this section, and has attached to the petition the proper statements of the circulators prescribed in subsection (h) of this section, it shall issue an order requiring the Board to accept the petition as of the date of submission for filing. Should the Superior Court of the District of Columbia hold in favor of the proposer, it may award court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the proposer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> Upon submission of a referendum petition to the Board, the Board shall notify the appropriate custodian of the act of the Council of the District of Columbia which is the subject of the referendum (either the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives) as provided in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-204.04.html">1-204.04</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-204.46.html">1-204.46</a> and the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, as appropriate, return such act or part or parts of such act to the Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia. No further action may be taken upon such act until after a referendum election is held. If, however, after the counting and validation procedure for signatures, which takes place pursuant to subsection (o) of this section, the referendum measure fails to meet the percentage and distribution requirements for signatures established in subsection (i) of this section, the act which was the subject of the referendum shall be again transmitted to the Congress for review as provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-206.02.html">1-206.02</a>(c).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(n)">(n)</span> When the Board accepts an initiative or referendum petition, whether in the normal course or at the direction of a court, the Board may detach, in the presence of the person submitting the petition or his or her designated representative, if he or she desires to be present, the sheets containing the signatures, and cause all of them to be firmly attached to 1 or more printed copies of the proposed initiative or referendum measure in such books or volumes as will be most convenient for counting, canvassing, and validating names and signatures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(o)">(o)</span><span class="level-num" id="(o)(1)">(1)</span> After acceptance of an initiative or referendum petition, the Board shall certify, within 30 calendar days after such petition has been accepted, whether or not the number of valid signatures on the initiative or referendum petition meets the qualifying percentage and ward distribution requirements established in subsection (i) of this section, and whether or not the necessary number of names and signatures of registered qualified electors of the District of Columbia, properly distributed by wards, appear on the initiative or referendum petition. This certification may be by a bona fide random and statistical sampling method. If the Board finds that the same person has signed a petition for the same initiative or referendum measure more than once, it shall count only 1 signature of such person. If a person who signs a petition is found to be a qualified registered elector in a ward other than that which was indicated on the petition sheet, such person shall be counted from the correct ward in determining whether or not an initiative or referendum measure qualifies for the ballot. Two persons representing the proposer(s) may be present during the counting and validation procedures. Should a political committee or committees exist in opposition to a particular proposed initiative or referendum measure, 2 persons representing such committee or committees may be present during the counting and validation procedures. The Board shall post, by making available for public inspection, petitions for initiatives or referenda, or facsimiles thereof, in the office of the Board, for 10 days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, beginning on the 3rd day after the petitions are filed. Any qualified elector may, within such 10-day period, challenge the validity of any petition, by a written statement duly signed by the challenger and filed with the Board, specifying concisely the alleged defects in such petition. The provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.08.html">1-1001.08</a>(o)(2) shall be applicable to such challenge.

The Board shall conduct an election on a referendum measure within 114 days after the date the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot. In the case of a referendum measure, if a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election will occur between 54 and 114 days after the date the measure has been certified as qualified to appear on the ballot, the Board may present the referendum measure at that election.</p>
