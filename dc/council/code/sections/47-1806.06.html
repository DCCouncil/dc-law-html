If a home is an integral part of a larger unit such as a multi-purpose building or a multi-dwelling building, property taxes accrued shall be that percentage of the total property taxes accrued as the value of the home bears to the total value of the property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> When a claimant owns or rents 2 or more different homes in the District in the same calendar year, “property taxes accrued” or “rent constituting property taxes accrued” shall be based on the claimant’s status as an owner or renter on December 31st of such calendar year.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The right to file under this section shall be personal to the claimant, but such right may be exercised by his legal guardian or attorney-in-fact. The right to file a claim shall not survive the death of a claimant. If a claimant dies after having filed a claim, any amount refunded as a result thereof shall be disbursed to his estate; provided, that if no executor or administrator qualifies therein within 2 years of the filing of the claim, or no petition for distribution of a small estate is filed pursuant to §§ 20-2101 and 20-2102, the claim shall not be allowed.</p>
