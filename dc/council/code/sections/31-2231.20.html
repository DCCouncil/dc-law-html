                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Unreasonably reject an insurance policy provided by a borrower for the protection of property securing a credit or lien. A rejection shall not be unreasonable if it is based on reasonable standards and uniformly applied relating to the extent of coverage required and the financial soundness and the services of an insurer. The standards shall not discriminate against a particular type of insurer or reject a policy because it contains coverage in addition to that required in the credit transaction;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Require, directly or indirectly, that a debtor, borrower, mortgagor, purchaser, insurer, broker, or agent pay a separate charge or consideration in connection with the handling of an insurance policy required as security for a loan on real estate or pay a separate charge or consideration of any kind for substituting the insurance policy of one insurer for that of another.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> A person who lends money or extends credit and who solicits insurance on real and personal property shall explain to the borrower in writing that the insurance related to the credit extension may be purchased from an insurer or agent of the borrower’s choice, subject only to the lender’s right to reject a given insurer or agent as provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section. Compliance with disclosures as to insurance required by truth-in-lending laws or comparable state laws shall constitute compliance with this subsection.</p>
