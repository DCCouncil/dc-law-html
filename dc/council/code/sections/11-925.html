    </p><h4>Prior Codifications</h4><p>1981 Ed., § 11-925.</p><h4>Editor's Notes</h4><p>Bill of Attainder:</p><p>This section was held unconstitutional in  Foretich v. U.S., 351 F. 3d 1198 (D.C. Cir. 2003).</p><p>Elizabeth Morgan Act: Legislation that prohibited noncustodial parent from obtaining visitation with daughter against her wishes, and in face of unproven allegations of sexual abuse, after she had turned thirteen, thereby effectively stigmatizing parent as child abuser and unfit parent, was enacted for punitive purpose and had to be held unconstitutional as impermissible bill of attainder, where narrowness with which statute applied, only to this particular noncustodial parent and his daughter, belied any nonpunitive purpose to deal with alleged child sexual abuse generally, and where fact that Congress would not have enacted this legislation if parent had agreed to voluntarily give up his visitation rights, showed that it was Congress’ purpose in enacting law to assume role of judicial tribunal and to impose its own determination of who was or was not fit parent.</p></section></section></section></section>
