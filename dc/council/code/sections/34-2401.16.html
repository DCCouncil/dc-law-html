                  <p>For the protection of the health of the residents of the District of Columbia and the employees of the United States government residing in Maryland near the District of Columbia boundary, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, upon the request of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, a body corporate, established by Chapter 313 of the Acts of 1916 of the State of Maryland, or upon the request of its legally appointed successor, is authorized to deliver water from the water supply system of the District of Columbia to said Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission or its successor for distribution to territory in Maryland within the Washington Suburban Sanitary District as designated in the aforesaid act, or any amendment thereto, and to connect District of Columbia water mains with water mains in the state of Maryland at such points at or near the District of Columbia line as may be agreed upon from time to time by the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, under the conditions hereinafter named, namely:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> That before such connections shall be made the said Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission or its legally appointed successor shall secure authority from the legislature of the State of Maryland to enter into an agreement with the said Mayor of the District of Columbia outlining the conditions under which the service is to be rendered.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The agreement between the Mayor of the District of Columbia and the said Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission or its legally appointed successor shall provide, among other things:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> That the meters on each of said connections shall be located within the District of Columbia and shall remain under the jurisdiction of the Mayor of the District of Columbia;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The rates at which water will be furnished, said rates to be based on the actual cost to the United States and the District of Columbia of delivering water to the points designated above, including an interest charge at 4% per annum and the cost of any payment required by § 113 of the Omnibus Budget Support Act of 1992 [<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/9-145.html">D.C. Law 9-145</a>] and a suitable allowance for depreciation;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> That payments for water so furnished shall be made through the Collector of Taxes of the District of Columbia at such times as the Mayor of the District of Columbia may direct, said payments to be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as other water rents collected in the District of Columbia are deposited;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> That at no time shall the amount of water furnished the said Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission or its successor exceed the amount that can be spared without jeopardizing the interests of the United States or of the District of Columbia;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> That the Mayor of the District of Columbia shall have at all times the right to investigate the distribution system in Maryland, and if, in his opinion, there is a wastage of water he shall have the right to curtail the supply to said sanitary district to the amount of such wastage.</p>
