                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The surety on any such bond may terminate its liability under such bond by giving 30 days written notice thereof, served either personally or by registered mail, to the principal and to the Mayor; and upon giving such notice the surety shall be discharged from all liability under such bond for any act or omission of the principal occurring after the expiration of 30 days from the date of service of such notice. Unless on or before the expiration of such period the principal shall duly file a new bond in like amount and conditioned as the original in substitution of the bond so terminated, the license of the principal to engage in such business shall likewise terminate upon the expiration of such period.
