Law 19-93 added a section to read as follows: “Sec. 2. Notwithstanding any conditions to the contrary or any procedures, requirements, or restrictions set forth in the Department of General Services Establishment Act of 2011, effective September 14, 2011 (<a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-21.html">D.C.

The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p></section></section></section></section>
