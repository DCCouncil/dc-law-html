                <p>“(b) Each Commission may involve representatives of other neighborhood groups in the work of its standing or special committees.</p>
                <p>“(c) The Mayor shall appoint a service area coordinator for each ward who shall act as the chairperson of the service area committee in that ward and shall coordinate all District government services at the ward level to residents of the ward.

                <p>“(B) Monitoring of Commission expenditures and responses to inquiries from individual Commissions on the legality of proposed actual expenditures.</p>
                <p>“(3) The Mayor shall provide assistance to the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions in the following areas:</p>
                <p>“(A) Legal interpretations of statutes concerning or affecting the Commissions, or of issues or concerns affecting the Commissions. These interpretations are to be obtained from the Corporation Counsel and may be requested directly by any Commission;</p>
                <p>“(B) Liaison efforts between the individual Commissions and District government entities to ensure responsiveness to Commission requests and compliance with current law; and</p>
                <p>“(C) Any other assistance necessary to ensure that a Commission is able to perform its statutory duties.</p>
                <p>“(e) Whenever a District agency is required to establish a citizen’s advisory mechanism, appointments to that mechanism shall be made in such a manner as to ensure as far as possible the equal representation on the mechanism of each electoral ward, provided that, members of the advisory mechanism possess skills relevant to the tasks for which the advisory mechanism was established and, in the event that the size of the advisory mechanism requires the appointment of more than 1 person per ward, ward appointments shall be made in such a manner so as to ensure as far as possible a fair representation of each Commission area.”</p>
                <h4>Applicability</h4>
                <p>
        Section 3(d) of Law 21-269 provided that section 2(g)(1)(A), (h)(4)(B), (h)(5)(A), (h)(7), (h)(8), and (i) of Law 21-269 shall apply on April 1st, 2017.
        </p>
                <p>Section 7036 of D.C. Law 22-33 amended <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-269.html#§3">§ 3 of D.C. Law 21-269</a>,  retaining the applicability restriction affecting this section, therefore the changes made to this section by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-269.html">D.C.

Law 21-269</a> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore that amendment has not been implemented.</p>
