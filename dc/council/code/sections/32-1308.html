                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Any employee or person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Living Wage Act, or any entity a member of which is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Living Wage Act may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the employer or other person violating this chapter, the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Living Wage Act and, upon prevailing, shall be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs and shall be entitled to such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation, including, without limitation, the payment of any back wages unlawfully withheld, reinstatement in employment, and injunctive relief. Actions may be maintained by one or more employees who may designate an agent or representative to maintain such action for and on behalf of themselves or on behalf of all employees similarly situated.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> For the purposes of this subsection, 2 or more employees are similarly situated if they:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Are or were employed by the same employer or employers, whether concurrently or otherwise, at some point during the applicable statute of limitations period;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Allege one or more violations that raise similar questions as to liability; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Seek similar forms of relief.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Employees shall not be considered dissimilar under this subsection solely because their:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Claims seek damages that differ in amount; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Job titles or other means of classifying employees differ in ways that are unrelated to their claims.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The court, in any action brought under this section shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the prevailing plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow costs of the action, including costs or fees of any nature, and reasonable attorney’s fees, to be paid by the defendant. In any judgment in favor of any employee under this section, and in any proceeding to enforce such a judgment, the court shall award to each attorney for the employee an additional judgment for costs, including attorney’s fees computed pursuant to the matrix approved in Salazar v. District of Columbia, 123 F.Supp.2d 8 (D.D.C. 2000), and updated to account for the current market hourly rates for attorney’s services. The court shall use the rates in effect at the time the determination is made.<em>Salazar v. District of Columbia</em></p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If the fees remain unpaid to the attorney at the time of any subsequent review, supplementation, or reconsideration of the fee award, the court shall update the award to reflect the hours actually expended and the market rates in effect at that time. No reduction shall be made from this rate, or from the hours actually expended, except upon clear and convincing evidence that the reduction will serve the remedial purposes of this law. Any court reviewing such a reduction shall review it de novo.<em>de novo</em></p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The Mayor shall not be required to pay the filing fee or other costs or fees of any nature or to file bond or other security of any nature in connection with any action or proceeding under this section.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Any action commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction on or after February 26, 2015, to enforce any cause of action for unpaid wages or liquidated damages under this chapter, the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Living Wage Act, or any regulation issued pursuant to this chapter, the Minimum Wage Revision Act, the Sick and Safe Leave Act, or the Living Wage Act, must be commenced within 3 years after the cause of action accrued, or of the last occurrence if the violation is continuous, or the cause of action shall be forever barred.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> This period is tolled:</p>
