                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the Mayor determines that any separate transactions were entered into over any 12-month period for that purpose, the Mayor may exercise authority provided under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-710.html">31-710</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> The Mayor, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> The Mayor shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds 10% of such corporation’s voting securities.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Thirty days after the Mayor has received notice of the declaration and has not within this period disapproved the payment; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The Mayor shall have approved the payment within the 30-day period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the lesser of 10% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding, or the net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month period ending the 31st day of December next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous 2 calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the Mayor’s approval, and such a declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until the Mayor has approved the payment of such a dividend or distribution, or the Mayor has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period referred to above.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this subchapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with 1 or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Not less than 1/3 of the directors of a domestic insurer and not less than 1/3 of the members of each committee of the board of directors of any domestic insurer shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or such an entity. At least 1 such person must be included in any quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors or any committee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish 1 or more committees comprised solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer, and who are not beneficial owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity. The committee or committees shall have responsibilities of nominating candidates for director for election by shareholders or policyholders, evaluating the performance of officers deemed to be principal officers of the insurer, and recommending to the board of directors the selection and compensation of the principal officers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection shall not apply to a domestic insurer if the person controlling the insurer is an insurer, a mutual insurance holding company, or a publicly held corporation that has a board of directors and committees that meet the requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)">(6)</span> An insurer may make application to the Mayor for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection, if the insurer’s annual direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and Federal Flood Program, is less than $300 million. An insurer may also make application to the Commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subsection based upon unique circumstances. The Mayor may consider various factors, including the type of business entity, volume of business written, availability of qualified board members, and the ownership or organizational structure of the entity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> For purposes of this subchapter, in determining whether an insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The extent to which the insurer’s business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> The number and size of risks insured in each line of business;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer’s insured risks;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(5)">(5)</span> The nature and extent of the insurer’s reinsurance program;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(6)">(6)</span> The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer’s investment portfolio;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(7)">(7)</span> The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer’s investment portfolio;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(8)">(8)</span> The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(9)">(9)</span> The adequacy of the insurer’s reserves; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(10)">(10)</span> The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The Mayor may treat such an investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in his or her judgment such an investment so warrants.</p>
