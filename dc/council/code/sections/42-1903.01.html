The unit owners’ association may be incorporated.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The bylaws shall provide whether or not the unit owners’ association shall have an executive board. The executive board, if any, shall, subsequent to the expiration of the period of declarant control specified pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-1903.02.html">42-1903.02</a>(a), be elected by the unit owners unless the unit owners vote to amend the bylaws to provide otherwise. If there is to be such a board, the bylaws shall specify the powers and responsibilities of the same and the number and terms of its members. The bylaws may delegate to such board, inter alia, any of the powers and responsibilities assigned by this chapter to the unit owners’ association. The bylaws shall also specify which, if any, of its powers and responsibilities the unit owners’ association or its executive board may delegate to a managing agent.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The bylaws shall provide whether or not there shall be officers in addition to the members of the executive board.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> In any case where an amendment to the declaration is required by subsection (b), (c), or (d) of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-1902.12.html">42-1902.12</a>, the person or persons required to execute the same shall also prepare and execute, and record simultaneously with such amendment, an amendment to the bylaws. The amendment to the bylaws shall allocate to the new units votes in the unit owners’ association, rights to future surplus funds, and liabilities for future common expenses not specially assessed, on the same bases as were used for such allocations to the units depicted on plats and plans recorded pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-1902.14.html">42-1902.14</a>; or shall abolish the votes appertaining to former units and reallocate their rights to future surplus funds, and their liabilities for future common expenses not specially assessed, to the remaining units in proportion to the relative rights and liabilities of the remaining units immediately prior to the amendment.</p>
