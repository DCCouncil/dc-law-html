                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Whether the procedure used by the healthcare entity in making its decision was fair and objective, and whether appropriate independent expert assistance was used;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(9)">(9)</span> Whether the healthcare entity will receive reasonably fair value for its assets and whether the market value of those assets has not been manipulated by the actions of the parties in a manner that causes the value of the assets to decrease;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(10)">(10)</span> Whether charitable funds are placed at unreasonable short-term or long term risk;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(12)">(12)</span> Whether the charitable assets have been placed in a charitable trust controlled independently of the for-profit entity or other parties to the conversion and used for appropriate charitable purposes consistent with the healthcare entity’s purposes or operation in the affected community; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(13)">(13)</span> Whether a right of first refusal has been retained by the healthcare entity to permit repurchase of the assets by a successor nonprofit person if and when the for-profit entity that results from conversion is subsequently proposed for sale, conversion, or merger.</p>

Such reasonable costs may include further expert review of the conversion, and a process to educate the public about the conversion and to obtain public comment.</p>
