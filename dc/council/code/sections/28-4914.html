                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Unless otherwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from the sender’s place of business and to be received at the recipient’s place of business. For purposes of this subsection, the following rules apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> If the sender or recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business of that person is the place having the closest relationship to the underlying transaction.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subsection (b) of this section establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.</p>

Except to the extent permitted by the other law, the requirements of this subsection may not be varied by agreement.</p>
