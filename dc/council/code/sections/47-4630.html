                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If the real property that is the subject of the abatement under section (b) of this section is a portion of a larger unit of real property that is assessed for real property tax under Chapter 8 of this title, the abatement shall be applied by reducing the assessment of the larger unit of real property by the ratio that the square footage of the occupied portion bears to the square footage of the larger unit of real property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The abatement shall be deducted from the real property tax bill or by issuing a refund (in the same amount as what would have been the abatement) to the high technology commercial real estate database and service provider, notwithstanding § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-811.02.html">47-811.02</a>, at the discretion of the Office of Tax and Revenue.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The abatement pursuant to this section shall apply once the high technology commercial real estate database and service provider has certified to the Department of Employment Services that the provider has hired at least 100 employees residing in the District of Columbia beyond the number of employees residing in the District of Columbia as of January 5, 2010 (“baseline number”); provided, that the high technology commercial real estate database and service provider shall maintain the baseline number throughout the entire term of the abatement. The failure to maintain the baseline number shall result in the forfeiture of the abatement during any period in which the baseline number is not met.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> Funds shall be sufficient within an approved budget and financial plan to support the fiscal impact of a tax abatement under this section.</p>
