Such annuity shall be computed at the rate of 21/2% of his average pay for each year of service up to 20 years of service and at the rate of 3% of his average pay for each year of service after 20 years of service, or, in the case of a member who first became such a member after the end of the 90-day period beginning on July 1, 1977, after 25 years of service, except that such annuity may not exceed 80% of the average pay of such member.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Any member who is an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia who completes 5 years of police or fire service and who is thereafter separated from his department (other than a member who retires under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-709.html">5-709</a>, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-710.html">5-710</a>, or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-712.html">5-712</a>) may elect, at the time of his separation, to receive a refund of the amount of deductions made from his salary under this subchapter.
