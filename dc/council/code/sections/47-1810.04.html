                <p>“(G) Net operating loss carryover.</p>

                <p>“(2) If any member owns an interest in a partnership that is not an unincorporated business, as defined by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1808.01.html">47-1808.01</a>, the income or loss of such partnership shall be apportioned to the District using the apportionment factor of the partnership, and the combined group member-partner’s distributive share of such income shall be added to the combined group member-partner’s income.”</p>
