A member’s net business income is determined by removing all but business income, expense, and loss from that member’s total income, as provided in this section and § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1810.05.html">47-1810.05</a>.</p>

The District net operating loss shall be applied as a deduction in the subsequent year only if that taxpayer has District source positive net income, whether or not the taxpayer is a member of a combined reporting group in the subsequent year.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Except where otherwise provided, no tax credit or post-apportionment deduction earned by one member of the group, but not fully used by or allowed to that member, may be used, in whole or in part, by another member of the group or applied, in whole or in part, against the total income of the combined group. A post-apportionment deduction carried over into a subsequent year as to the member that incurred it, and available as a deduction to that member in a subsequent year, will be considered in the computation of the income of that member in the subsequent year regardless of the composition of that income as apportioned, allocated, or wholly within the District.</p>
