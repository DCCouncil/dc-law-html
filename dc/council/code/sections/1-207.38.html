In designating such neighborhoods, the Council shall consider natural geographic boundaries, election districts, and divisions of the District made for the purpose of administration of services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Elections for members of each Advisory Neighborhood Commission shall be nonpartisan, and shall be administered by the Board of Elections and Ethics.

The funding apportioned to each Advisory Neighborhood Commission shall bear the same ratio to the full sum allotted as the population of the neighborhood bears to the population of the District. The Council may authorize additional methods of financing Advisory Neighborhood Commissions.</p>
