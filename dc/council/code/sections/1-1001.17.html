                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)">(1)</span> A recall petition for an elected officer from a ward shall include the valid signatures of 10 percent of the registered qualified electors of the ward from which the officer was elected. The 10 percent shall be computed from the total number of the qualified registered electors from such ward according to the latest official count of the registered qualified electors made by the Board 30 days prior to the date of initial submission to the Board of the notice of intention to recall.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> A recall petition for an at-large elected official shall contain the signatures of registered qualified electors in number equal to 10 percent of the registered qualified electors in the District of Columbia: Provided, that the total signatures submitted include 10 percent of the registered electors in each of 5 or more of the 8 wards. The 10 percent shall be computed from the total number of registered qualified electors from the District of Columbia according to the same procedures established in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(3)">(3)</span> A recall petition for an elected officer from a single-member district shall include the valid signatures of 10% of the registered qualified electors of the single-member district from which the officer was elected, except when the elected officer has missed all regularly scheduled meetings of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission of which the single-member district is a part for at least a three-month period, in which case the recall petition must only include the valid signatures of 5% of the registered qualified electors of the single-member district from which the officer was elected. The 5% or 10% shall be computed from the total number of registered qualified electors from the single-member district in accordance with the same procedures established in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> Upon the submission of a recall petition by the proposer to the Board, the Board shall refuse to accept the petition upon any of the following grounds:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(1)">(1)</span> Except in the case of a recall petition for an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, the financial disclosure statement of the proposer has not been filed pursuant to §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1163.07.html">1-1163.07</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1163.09.html">1-1163.09</a>;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> The petition is not the proper form established in subsection (e) of this section;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(3)">(3)</span> The restrictions for initiating the recall process established in subsection (c) of this section were not observed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(4)">(4)</span> The time limitation established in subsection (g) of this section within which the recall petition may be circulated and submitted to the Board has expired;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(5)">(5)</span> The petition clearly bears on its face an insufficient number of signatures to qualify for the ballot; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(6)">(6)</span> The petition was circulated by persons who were not qualified petition circulators at the time of circulation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> If the Board refuses to accept the recall petition when submitted to it, the proposer submitting such petition to the Board may appeal, within 10 days after the Board’s refusal, to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for a writ in the nature of mandamus to compel the Board to accept such recall petition. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia shall expedite the consideration of the matter. If the Superior Court of the District of Columbia determines that the petition is legal in form and apparently meets the requirements established under this section, it shall issue an order requiring the Board to accept the petition as of the date of submission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> Should the Superior Court of the District of Columbia hold in favor of the proposer, it may award court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to the proposer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)">(1)</span> After the acceptance of a recall petition, the Board shall certify, within 30 calendar days after such petition has been filed, whether or not the number of valid signatures on the recall petition meets the qualifying percentage and ward distribution requirements established in subsection (h) of this section and whether or not the necessary number of signatures of registered qualified electors of the District of Columbia, properly distributed by wards, appears on the petition. This certification may be made by a bona fide random and statistical sampling method. In a case in which an officer elected from a ward is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a recall petition for that elected officer is found not to be a registered qualified elector in the ward indicated on the petition, that name and signature shall not be counted toward determining whether or not the recall measure qualifies. In a case in which an officer elected at-large is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a recall petition for that elected officer is found to be a registered qualified elector in a ward other than what was indicated on the petition sheet, such person shall be counted from the correct ward in determining whether or not a recall measure for an at-large elected officer qualified. In a case in which an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner is sought to be recalled, if a person who signs a petition to recall that Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner is found not to be a registered qualified elector in the single-member district indicated on the petition, the person’s name and signature shall not be counted toward determining whether or not the recall measure qualifies. If the Board finds that the same person has signed a petition for the same recall measure more than once, it shall count only 1 signature of such person. Two persons representing the petitioner(s) seeking the recall and 2 persons representing the elected officer sought to be recalled may be present to observe during the counting and validating procedure.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)">(2)</span> The Board shall post, within 3 calendar days after the acceptance of a recall petition, whether in the normal course or at the direction of a court, by making available for public inspection in the office of the Board, the petition for the recall measure or facsimile. Any registered qualified elector, during a 10-day period (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, except that with respect to a petition to recall a member of an Advisory Neighborhood Commission SMD, the 10-day period shall not include Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), beginning on the day the recall petition was posted by the Board, may challenge the validity of such petition by a written statement duly signed by the challenger and filed with the Board, specifying concisely the alleged defects in the petition. The provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.08.html">1-1001.08</a>(o)(2) shall be applicable to a challenge and the Board may establish any necessary rules and regulations consistent that concerns the process of the challenge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(3)">(3)</span> For the purpose of verifying a signature on any petition filed pursuant to this section, the Board shall first determine that the address on the petition is the same as the residence shown on the signer’s voter registration record. If the address is different, the signature shall not be counted as valid unless the Board’s records show that the person was registered to vote from the address listed on the petition at the time the person signed the petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> After determining that the number and validity of signatures in the recall petition meet the requirements established in this section, the Board shall certify the sufficiency of such recall petition and shall fix the date of a special election to determine whether the elected officer who is the subject of the recall shall be removed from his or her office. The Board shall conduct an election for this purpose within 114 days after the date the petition to recall has been certified as to its sufficiency. If a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election will occur between 54 and 114 days after the date the petition to recall has been certified as to its sufficiency, the Board may present the recall measure at that election. In the case of a proposed recall of an officer elected to represent a particular ward, the recall election shall be conducted only in that ward. In the case of a proposed recall of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, the recall election shall be conducted in one of the following manners unless conducted in accordance with a previously scheduled general, primary, or special election pursuant to this subsection:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(1)">(1)</span><span class="level-num" id="(l)(1)(A)">(A)</span> In the single-member district represented by the Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner at the voting precinct containing the majority of the registered qualified electors; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(1)(B)">(B)</span> If the voting precinct is unavailable, at an appropriate alternative site within the single-member district;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)">(2)</span> By postal ballot by mailing by 1st class mail no later than 7 days prior to the date of the election an official ballot issued by the Board. The ballots shall be mailed to each qualified registered elector in the single-member district at the address at which the elector is registered, except for those persons who have made arrangements with the Board for absentee voting pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.09.html">1-1001.09</a>(b)(2). The Board shall, pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.05.html">1-1001.05</a>(a)(14), issue rules to implement the provisions of this paragraph. The ballots shall be printed with prepaid 1st class postage and shall be postmarked no later than midnight of the day of the election.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(3)">(3)</span> A special election called to consider the recall of an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner shall not be considered an election for the purposes of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.16.html">1-1001.16</a>(p).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> The Board shall place the recall measure on the ballot in substantially the following form:</p>
                <p>FOR the recall of (insert the name of the elected officer and the office</p>
                <p>held)</p>
                <p>AGAINST the recall of (insert the name of the elected officer and the office held)</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(n)">(n)</span> Based on the results of the special election held to decide the outcome of the recall measure, the elected officer sought to be recalled shall be removed from that office: Provided, that a majority of the qualified electors voting in the recall election vote to remove him or her.
