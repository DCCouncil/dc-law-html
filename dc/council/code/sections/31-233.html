                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> If the Commissioner determines that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any activity prohibited by this chapter or any rule or order adopted under this chapter, and that immediate action against such person is in the public interest, the Commissioner may issue a summary order directing the person to cease and desist from engaging in such activity; provided, that the summary cease and desist order shall give the person:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Notice of the opportunity for a hearing before the Commissioner to determine whether the summary cease and desist order should be vacated, modified, or entered as final, and that the hearing shall be conducted according to the rules for contested cases set forth in Chapter 38 of Title 26 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Notice that the summary cease and desist order will be entered as final if the person does not request a hearing within 15 days of service of the order as provided in Chapter 5 of Title 2.</p>
