The compact shall be effective when the jurisdiction has enacted the compact into law. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute that repeals the compact, but the repeal shall not take effect until 2 years after the effective date of the statute that repeals the compact and written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the executive head of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a party state shall not affect the rights, duties, or obligations under this compact of any sending state with respect to a placement made prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">ARTICLE X</span><span class="level-heading"> Construction and severability.</span> The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of the compact.
