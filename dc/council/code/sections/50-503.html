                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> The Board, in accordance with the rules and regulations issued pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, shall provide arbitration for claims filed by consumers against manufacturers, their agents, or dealers pursuant to §§ <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-502.html">50-502</a> and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-505.html">50-505</a>; for claims voluntarily filed by consumers against the provider of any consumer goods or services, who agrees to arbitration, pursuant to rules and regulations issued by the Mayor; and for claims filed pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-2405.html">§ 31-2405</a> by parties agreeing to arbitration pursuant to rules and regulations issued by the Mayor.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(s)(2)(B)">(B)</span> The arbitrator or arbitration panel exceeded its powers;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(s)(2)(C)">(C)</span> The arbitrator or arbitration panel failed to conform to the rules and regulations issued pursuant to this chapter, and the failure to conform prejudiced the rights of a party to the complaint; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(s)(2)(D)">(D)</span> The award is based on a numerical error or other error of fact which the Board has failed to correct.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(s)(3)">(3)</span> If the court determines the arbitration process was valid but grants the petition for a trial de novo on other grounds, the decision of the Board shall be admissible as evidence and shall be presumed correct.</p>
