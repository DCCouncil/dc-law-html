                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)(B)">(B)</span> Continuation of the child in the child’s home would be contrary to the welfare of the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> When a judge finds that a child’s detention or shelter care is required under the criteria of section 16-2310, he shall then hear evidence presented by the Corporation Counsel to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the allegations in the petition are true. The child, his parent, guardian or custodian may present evidence on the issues and be heard in their own behalf.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> When a judge finds there is probable cause to believe the allegations in the petition are true, he shall order the child to be placed or continued in detention or shelter care and set forth is reasons.
