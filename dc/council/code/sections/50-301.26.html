                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The DFHV shall have one year from October 22, 2012, to modernize the taxicab fleet, and make vehicle and equipment improvements, including:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> A meter system that facilitates non-cash payment of a taxicab fare, including credit cards, debit cards, and other generally acceptable means of purchasing goods and services as defined by the DFHV, prints receipts to passengers automatically, and allows non-cash payment to be made in the rear compartment of the taxicab without handling by the taxicab operator. This system shall contain an authenticated login unique to each individual taxicab operator, and shall electronically collect trip-sheet data through the use of GPS technology. GPS data shall not be collected unless a taxicab operator is currently logged into the meter system. The meter system shall consist of an information monitor for the taxicab operator that is able to send and receive text messages, and shall allow for integration with web, tablet, or cellular phone dispatch applications that can transmit the location of potential passengers to the taxicab operator information monitor. The DFHV may elect to certify the technology that can integrate with the meter system. The system shall also include an information monitor for passengers that, at a minimum, shall provide audio-visual content, including advertising, and is capable of being muted or turned off by the passenger for the duration of the ride;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Uniform cruising lights that clearly display a taxicab’s identification number, as well as identify when a taxicab is occupied, on-call, off-duty, or available to accept a fare; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Uniform color and an emblem symbolizing the flag of the District. The DFHV shall issue rules allowing all vehicles operated by taxicab companies, fleets, and associations to place an insignia or logo on the vehicle, requiring the insignia to be of a certain size and placement on the vehicle. If a taxicab is powered by an alternative fuel, it may display this information on the exterior of the vehicle with a term or symbol approved by the DFHV. Taxicabs licensed to operate in the District as of the date on which the DFHV issues rules to implement this paragraph shall be permitted to maintain their current color scheme. The uniform color and emblem shall apply only to new vehicles entering taxicab service or when owners choose to repaint their existing vehicles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The DFHV may issue rules and regulations regarding the installation or use of counterfeit or non-compliant public vehicle-for-hire equipment or technology systems. Any person who willfully installs or uses any counterfeit or imitation public vehicle-for-hire equipment or technology systems shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be imprisoned no more than 180 days or fined no more than $1,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> The DFHV shall create a notice to be posted in a conspicuous location in all taxicabs in clear view of passengers. The notice shall be at least 5 inches by 7 inches in size, and shall include the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(A)">(A)</span> A statement that a taxicab must accept credit cards through the approved taximeter system;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(B)">(B)</span> A statement that a taxicab shall not operate without a functioning taximeter system;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(C)">(C)</span> A statement that failure to accept a credit card is a violation of the law and is punishable by fine; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(D)">(D)</span> The information required for passengers to submit an alleged violation, including a telephone number and website address to the agency responsible for handling the complaint.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> To obtain a copy of the notice required to be posted under this subsection, the owner or operator of a taxicab required to post the notice shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Print the notice from the DFHV website; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Request that the notice be mailed and submit payment to the DFHV for the cost of printing and first-class postage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The DFHV shall post a notice on its website indicating that compliance with this subsection is mandatory as well as the penalties for failure to comply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> A violation of this subsection shall be punishable by a civil fine or other penalty provided by regulation.</p>
