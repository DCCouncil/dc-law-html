A vehicle subject to impoundment shall be taken to a District government impoundment facility, or a storage lot owned or operated by a towing company, as shall be determined by the Department.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Except for vehicles disposed of pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-2421.06.html">50-2421.06</a>, the Department shall send an impoundment notice, by first class mail, to the last known address of the owners of record of the vehicle, and any lienholders of record, as that information is indicated in the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles or in the records of the appropriate agency of the jurisdiction where the vehicle is registered. If the vehicle was seized from private property, notice shall also be sent, by first class mail, to the owner of that property, as indicated in the records of the Office of Tax and Revenue.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The impoundment notice required by subsection (b) of this section shall be mailed no later than 5 days after the vehicle is received at an impoundment or storage facility and shall:</p>

The notice of infraction shall be considered issued, within the meaning of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/50-2302.05.html">50-2302.05</a>, on the 5th day after the impoundment notice is mailed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The Director shall determine whether each impounded vehicle has been reported to law enforcement agencies as stolen, and shall record the vehicle identification number for each impounded vehicle in a database format that can be accessed by law enforcement personnel.
