                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> No retail dealer shall sell, assign, or otherwise transfer a marketing agreement or any interest therein unless he furnishes prior written notice to the distributor of his intention to make such sale, assignment, or other transfer. Such notice shall be sent to the distributor by registered or certified mail and shall include the prospective transferee’s name and address, a statement of the prospective transferee’s financial qualifications, a statement of the prospective transferee’s business experience during the previous 5 years, and a statement of the prospective transferee’s ability, character, and credit history.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The distributor shall either approve or disapprove such sale, assignment, or other transfer in writing within 60 days after receipt of the notice specified in subsection (b) of this section. A distributor’s failure to notify the retail dealer of his approval or disapproval shall be construed as an approval of the proposed sale, assignment, or other transfer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> In order for a sale, assignment, or other transfer of a marketing agreement to be valid, the prospective transferee shall agree in writing to comply with all valid requirements, conditions, and provisions of the existing marketing agreement which may be applicable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> A prospective transferee shall have the right to terminate or repudiate any sale, assignment, or other transfer of a marketing agreement or any interest therein for any reason, without the imposition of any damages or penalties for such action and without any recourse by the transferor or distributor for such action, within 7 days, not including Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays, after the day on which the sale, assignment, or other transfer is consummated. In order to exercise his right under this subsection, the transferee shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Mail written notice, by registered or certified mail, to the transferor and the distributor of his intention to exercise his right under this subsection within the period specified in this subsection;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Discontinue use of any trademark presently being used by such transferee pursuant to the marketing agreement;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(D)">(D)</span> Deliver or tender to the transferor full possession of any retail service station transferred to the transferee within 10 days after mailing the notice specified in this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> The transferee shall receive full credit, or the cash equivalent, for all money, equipment, and merchantable products delivered or tendered to the transferor or distributor, as appropriate, pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection. Nothing contained within this subsection shall be construed as granting a similar right to terminate or repudiate to either the transferor or the distributor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> Upon the death or retirement of a retail dealer, the distributor shall grant a 1-year trial marketing agreement in the name of a successor who has been designated by the retail dealer and approved by the distributor. The designated successors shall be limited to a retail dealer’s spouse, adult children, adult stepchildren, and the approval of the designated successor by the distributor shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> In order for the requirement in paragraph (1) of this subsection to be effective, the retail dealer shall have provided written notice to the distributor designating the successor dealer. The distributor shall approve or disapprove the designated successor, in writing, within 60 days after receipt of the written designation notice. A distributor’s failure to notify a retail dealer of the approval or disapproval of any designated successor shall be construed as an approval of the designated successor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> A 1-year trial marketing agreement shall contain the same terms and conditions as were contained in the marketing agreement in effect prior to the retail dealer’s death or retirement. Pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, a successor dealer, with the approval of the distributor, may sell, assign, or otherwise transfer the trial marketing agreement granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
