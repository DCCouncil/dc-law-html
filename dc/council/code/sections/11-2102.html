                <p>1973 Ed., § 11-2102.</p>
                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p>Pub. L. 108-335 repealed subsec. (a)(2) which had read as follows: “(2) give bond, with two or more sureties, to be approved by the chief judge of the Superior Court, in the amount designated by the court, faithfully to discharge the duties of the office, and seasonably to record (A) the decrees and orders of the court in any matters over which the court exercises probate jurisdiction or powers, (B) all wills proved before the Register of Wills or the court, and (C) all other matters directed to be recorded in the court or in the office.”</p>
                <p>Pub. L. 109-356 made a technical correction to Pub. L. 108-335 that deleted “bond;” from the section heading, substituted “seasonably record” for “give bond, with two or more sureties, to be approved by the chief judge of the Superior Court, in the amount designated by the court, faithfully to discharge the duties of the office, and seasonably to record” in subsec. (a)(2), and deleted the third sentence of subsec. (a) which read as follows: “The bond shall be entered in full upon the minutes of the Superior Court and the original filed with the records of the Superior Court.”</p>

                <h4>Effective Dates</h4>
                <p>Section 116(c) of Pub. L. 109-356 provided that the amendments made by this section shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2005 [Pub. L. 108-335].</p>
