The employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, taking adverse action against an employee within 90 days of an employee or other person’s engagement in the activities set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall raise a presumption that such action is retaliation, which may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that such action was taken for other permissible reasons.</p>

If an administrative law judge finds that an employer or other person has engaged in retaliation, the administrative law judge shall, by an order which shall describe with particularity the nature of the violation, assess a civil penalty against the employer or other person of not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000. The administrative law judge shall also order all appropriate relief including:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> Enjoining the conduct;</p>

The order shall contain a finding that a violation has or has not occurred and the amount of damages, costs, interest, or penalties owed. If the person receiving the violation does not request a hearing, the person shall transmit to the Mayor the amount of the penalty within 15 days of receipt of notification of the violation.</p>
