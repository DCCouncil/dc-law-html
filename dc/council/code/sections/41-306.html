                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)(A)">(A)</span> If the Court concludes that the District has met its burden under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Court shall consider whether there is any condition or combination of conditions, other than retention of seized property, that will reasonably protect the interests of the District pending the conclusion of the forfeiture proceeding and whether those interests outweigh any countervailing interests of the owner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)(B)">(B)</span> If the Court concludes that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably protect the interests of the District pending the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings and that those interests outweigh countervailing interests of the owner, the Court shall grant the District’s motion to retain the property pending the conclusion of any forfeiture proceedings.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)(C)(i)">(i)</span> Any condition permitted by subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)(C)(ii)">(ii)</span> In the case of property other than real property and if the owner is not indigent, the payment of a bond not to exceed 5% of the fair market value of the property, which for a vehicle shall be the bluebook value.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> If the owner establishes that there is probable cause that the seized currency is necessary to assist the owner in securing counsel in a pending criminal matter related to the seizure or to meet the basic necessities of life, including the purchase of food, payment of utilities, provision of shelter, transportation costs, support of the owner’s family, or operation of a lawful business, the portion of the currency necessary for demonstrated needs shall be returned.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> If the District retains possession of the currency or any portion of the currency pending disposition of the forfeiture case, the currency shall continue to be treated in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/23-532.html">23-532</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(1)">(1)</span> The property has been determined by the Court not to be forfeitable;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> The District has decided not to pursue forfeiture; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(3)">(3)</span> If the property is declared forfeited, the owner surrenders the property to the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> The Court shall issue an order at the conclusion of the hearing or as soon thereafter as practicable unless the parties consent to the delay.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)">(1)</span> An order granting or denying the District’s motion to retain the seized property is a final order for purposes of appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)">(2)</span> Upon motion of an appealing party, the Court may stay the effect of an order directing release of property pending appeal if the Court finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)(A)">(A)</span> A substantial question is raised by the appeal;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Irreparable harm is likely to occur to the moving party if the stay is not granted; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)(C)">(C)</span> The hardship to the opposing party is outweighed by the threat of irreparable harm to the moving party.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span><span class="level-num" id="(l)(1)">(1)</span> If the District alleges that the owner has violated a condition of interim release, the District shall file a motion with the Court requesting a hearing for the owner to show cause why interim custody should not be revoked pending final forfeiture proceedings. If the condition the owner is alleged to have violated was imposed by agreement pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the District shall file the motion in court at the time it files the libel of information pursuant to §  41-307.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)">(2)</span> At the hearing, if the Court determines the owner violated a condition of interim release:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)(A)">(A)</span> The owner shall lose custody of the property pending final forfeiture proceedings; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Where the violation diminishes the value of the property, the owner shall be personally liable for diminished value if the property is ultimately deemed forfeitable; provided, that if the violation makes the property unavailable or entirely without value, the measure of the owner’s liability shall be the fair market value of the property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> Nothing in this section shall preclude the owner from seeking any other relief provided by law or regulation.</p>
