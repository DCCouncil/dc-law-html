                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Apply any available money of the ward to the ward’s current needs for support, care, habilitation, and treatment;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Conserve any excess money of the ward for the ward’s future needs, but if a conservator has been appointed for the estate of the ward, the guardian, at least quarterly, shall pay to the conservator money of the ward to be conserved for the ward’s future needs;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Report in writing the condition of the ward and of the ward’s estate that has been subject to the guardian’s possession or control, as ordered by the court on petition of any person interested in the ward’s welfare or on any order of the court, but at least semiannually;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Make decisions on behalf of the ward by conforming as closely as possible to a standard of substituted judgment or, if the ward’s wishes are unknown and remain unknown after reasonable efforts to discern them, make the decision on the basis of the ward’s best interests;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> Include the ward in the decision-making process to the maximum extent of the ward’s ability; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> Encourage the ward to act on his or her own behalf whenever he or she is able to do so, and to develop or regain capacity to make decisions in those areas in which he or she is in need of decision-making assistance, to the maximum extent possible.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Take custody of the person of the ward and establish the ward’s place of abode within or without the District, if consistent with the terms of any order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Institute proceedings, including administrative proceedings, or take other appropriate action to compel the performance by any person of a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare of the ward, if no conservator for the estate of the ward has been appointed;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Consent to medical examination and medical or other professional care, treatment, or advice for the ward, without liability, by reason of the consent for injury to the ward resulting from the negligence or acts of third persons, unless the guardian fails to act in good faith;</p>
