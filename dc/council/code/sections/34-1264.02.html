                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> “Cable operator” means a person providing cable service as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

A violation of this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $5000 or imprisonment of up to 1 year, or both.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Make or maintain either a physical, electrical, acoustical, or other connection to a cable system, or tamper, interfere with, damage, or cut any cables, wires, components, moderns, lock boxes, pedestals, or other equipment of a cable operator, with the intent to deprive a cable operator of compensation for its service.

A violation of this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 1 year or both.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> A person who commits a violation under subsection (b) of this section, for payment or offer of payment, or with the intent to profit from any consideration received or expected, shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be subject to a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years, or both.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> A person convicted for the violation of any of the offenses under subsection (b) of this section 3 times within a 10-year period shall be guilty of a felony.</p>
