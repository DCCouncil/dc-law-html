The Authority may issue bonds in one or more series and may provide for one or more consolidated bond issues, in such principal amounts and with such terms and provisions as the Board may deem necessary. The bonds may be secured by a pledge of all or any part of the property, revenues and franchises under its control. Bonds may be issued by the Authority in such amount, with such maturities and in such denominations and form or forms, whether coupon or registered, as to principal alone or as to both principal and interest, as may be determined by the Board.

The resolution of the Board authorizing any bond or any indenture so authorized under which the bonds are issued may include all such covenants and other provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this Title, other than any restriction on the regulatory powers vested in the Board by this Title, as the Board may deem necessary or desirable for the issue, payment, security, protection or marketing of the bonds, including without limitation covenants and other provisions as to the rates or amounts of fees, rents and other charges to be charged or made for use of the facilities; the use, pledge, custody, securing, application and disposition of such revenues, of the proceeds of the bonds, and of any other moneys or contracts of the Authority; the operation, maintenance, repair and reconstruction of the facilities and the amounts which may be expended therefor; the sale, lease or other disposition of the facilities; the insuring of the facilities and of the revenues derived therefrom; the construction or other acquisition of other facilities; the issuance of additional bonds or other indebtedness; the rights of the bondholders and of any trustee for the bondholders upon default by the Authority or otherwise; and the modification of the provisions of the indenture and of the bonds. Reference on the face of the bonds to such resolution or indenture by its date of adoption or the apparent date on the face thereof is sufficient to incorporate all of the provisions thereof and of this Title into the body of the bonds and their appurtenant coupons. Each taker and subsequent holder of the bonds or coupons, whether the coupons are attached to or detached from the bonds, has recourse to all of the provisions of the indenture and of this Title and is bound thereby.</p><p><center>Maximum Maturity</center></p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">33.</span> No bond or its terms shall mature in more than fifty years from its own date and in the event any authorized issue is divided into two or more series or divisions, the maximum maturity date herein authorized shall be calculated from the date on the face of each bond separately, irrespective of the fact that different dates may be prescribed for the bonds of each separate series or division of any authorized issue.</p><p><center>Tax Exemption</center></p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">34.</span> All bonds and all other evidences of debt issued by the Authority under the provisions of this Title and the interest thereon shall at all times be free and exempt from all taxation by or under authority of any signatory parties, except for transfer, inheritance and estate taxes.</p><p><center>Interest</center></p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">35.</span> Bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Board, payable annually or semiannually.</p><p><center>Place of Payment</center></p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">36.</span> The Board may provide for the payment of the principal and interest of bonds at any place or places within or without the signatory states, and in any specified lawful coin or currency of the United States of America.</p><p><center>Execution</center></p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">37.</span> The Board may provide for the execution and authentication of bonds by the manual, lithographed or printed facsimile signature of members of the Board, and by additional authentication by a trustee or fiscal agent appointed by the Board; provided, however, that one of such signatures shall be manual.

The Board may sell bonds at less than their par or face value but no issue of bonds may be sold at an aggregate price below the par or face value thereof if such sale would result in a net interest cost to the Authority calculated upon the entire issue so sold in excess of the applicable rate determined by the Board, payable semiannually, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds according to standard tables of bond values, deducting the amount of any premium to be paid on the redemption of any bonds prior to maturity.

Congressional approval was granted pursuant to H.J. Res. 480, Pub. L. 100-285, April 7, 1988. The Legislative History of H.J. Res. 480, H.R. Rep. 521, 100th Cong., 2d. Sess., explains that “H.J. Res. 480 represents the amendments ratified by each of the three jurisdictions which are substantially similar. . . . [P]rovisions which are not substantially similar are not included in H.J. Res. 480, and are therefore not granted the consent of the Congress.” The version of § 76(e) as passed by the Council was not included in the Resolution because there were discrepancies between the provisions adopted by the District and that adopted by Maryland and Virginia. Since Congress did not enact the amended version of § 76(e), the 1976 version as set out above is still in effect. This version, which was enacted pursuant to Pub. L. 94-306, is contained in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact (1988 ed.) published by WMATA.</p><p>Execution of Compact: The Compact set forth in this section was signed as follows: By the Governor of Maryland, November 17, 1966; by the Governor of Virginia, November 21, 1966; and by the President of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, November 22, 1966.</p><p>Policy of Congress: Section 805 of the Act of December 15, 1971, 85 Stat. 659, Pub. L. 92-196, declared the policy of Congress that, to the extent that costs of the regional transit projects are not covered by the user charges, such costs would be equitably charged among the federal, District of Columbia, and participating local governments.</p><p>Mayor to enter into agreements and effective date: Section 3 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/10-244.html">D.C. Law 10-244</a> provided that the Mayor of the District of Columbia shall, for the District of Columbia, enter into agreements with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland to make technical amendments to Title III of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact, so long as the amended version of the Compact then substantially conforms to the amendments in section 2 of the act. The technical amendments shall become effective when the Mayor executes the agreements concerning the Compact.</p><p>Land for D.C. transportation facilities: Section 1 of Pub. L. 98-340 provided that the Architect of the Capitol and the District of Columbia is directed to enter into an agreement for the conveyance of certain real property, the Secretary of the Interior is directed to permit the District of Columbia and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to construct, maintain, and operate certain transportation improvements on federal property, and the Architect of the Capitol is directed to provide the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority access to certain real property.</p><p>Adoption of amendments subject to Congressional consent: Pursuant to § 2 of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-138.html">D.C.

Section 402(425) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p><h4>Resolutions</h4><p>Resolution 13-682, the “Tri-Jurisdiction Joint Legislative Commission on Interstate Transportation Emergency Resolution of 2000”, was approved effective October 17, 2000.</p></section></section></section></section>
