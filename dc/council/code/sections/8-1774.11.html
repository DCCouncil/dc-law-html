                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/18-195.html">D.C. Law 18-195</a> rewrote subsecs. (b)(2) and (c); and, in subsec. (b)(4), substituted “established by the Commission” for “operated by DDOE”.</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/18-370.html">D.C. Law 18-370</a> rewrote subsec. (c), which had read as follows: “(c) The Energy Assistance Trust Fund shall be used solely to fund the existing low-income programs in the amount of $2.3 million annually; provided, that the EATF shall also be used to fund the Residential Aid Discount program in the amount of $5.2 million in fiscal year 2010. The Commission may examine and reconcile any differences between the actual discount provided to customers under the Residential Aid Discount program in fiscal year 2010 and the amount collected through the assessment imposed by subsection (b) of this section. If the assessment for June through September 2010 is not sufficient to fund the program, the Commission may provide for an assessment that allows the electric company to recover the difference from its customers. If the assessment for June through September 2010 is greater than the actual discount, the Commission may require the electric company to return any overcollection to its customers.”</p>
