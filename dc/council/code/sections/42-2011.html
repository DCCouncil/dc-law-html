Said petition may be served on the person designated in the bylaws in conformity with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-2014.html">42-2014</a>(a)(7). The court may thereupon lay a rule upon the council of co-owners, unless they shall voluntarily appear and admit the allegations of the petition, to show cause, under oath, on or before the 10th day, exclusive of Sundays and legal holidays, after service of such rule, why the prayers of said petition should not be granted. If no cause be shown against the prayer of the petition by the council of co-owners, or by any one of the co-owners, the court may determine in a summary way whether the facts warrant termination and thereupon the court may decree the particular horizontal property regime terminated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In the event a horizontal property regime is terminated or waived, the property shall be deemed to be owned in common by the co-owners, and the undivided interest in the property owned in common which shall appertain to each co-owner shall be the percentage of undivided interest previously owned by such co-owner in the common elements in the property as set forth in the declaration under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-2006.html">42-2006</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Upon such termination and waiver the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-2010.html">42-2010</a> shall no longer be applicable and reference to the principal project thereupon shall be to the plat and record of the prior land subdivision and thereupon the restraint against partition or division of the co-ownership imposed by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-2007.html">42-2007</a> shall no longer apply. In the event of such partition suit the net proceeds shall be divided among all the unit owners, in proportion to their respective undivided ownership of the common elements, after first paying off, out of the respective shares of the unit owners, all liens on the unit of each unit owner. To be valid such termination shall be recorded among the land records of the District of Columbia.</p>
