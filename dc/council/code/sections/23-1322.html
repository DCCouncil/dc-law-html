                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)(B)">(B)</span> The date the defendant is first detained under subsection (b) of this section by order of a judicial officer of the District of Columbia following a re-arrest or order of detention after having been conditionally released under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/23-1321.html">23-1321</a> or after having escaped;</p>
