                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Investigate and ascertain, from time to time, the quality and quantity of gas supplied by persons or corporations; examine or investigate the methods employed by such persons and corporations in manufacturing, distributing, and supplying gas and in transmitting or distributing electricity for light, heat, or power, and in transmitting the same, and have power to order such with respect to manufacturing, distributing, or supplying such gas, or with respect to transmitting or distributing such electricity as will reasonably promote the public interest, preserve the public health, and protect those using such gas or electricity and those employed in the manufacture and distribution of gas or the transmission or distribution of electricity or in the manufacture and operation of the works, wires, poles, lines, conduits, ducts, and systems connected therewith, and have power to order reasonable improvements and extensions of the works, wires, poles, lines, conduits, ducts, and other reasonable devices, apparatus, and property of gas companies and electric companies.</p>

For the purpose of determining whether the gas manufactured, distributed, or sold by such persons or corporations for lighting, heating, or power purposes conforms to the standards of illuminating power, purity, and pressure, and for the purpose of determining whether the efficiency of the electric transmission or distribution system conforms to the orders issued by the Commission, the Commission shall have power, of its own motion, to examine and investigate the plants and methods employed in manufacturing, delivering, and supplying gas or transmitting or distributing electricity, and shall have access, through it members or persons employed and authorized by it to make such examinations and investigations, to all parts of the manufacturing plants owned, used, or operated for the manufacture, transmission, or distribution of gas or the transmission or distribution of electricity by any such person or corporation. Any employee or agent of the Commission who divulges any fact or information which may come to his knowledge during the course of any such inspection or examination, except insofar as he may be directed by the Commission, or by a court or judge thereof, or authorized by law, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500 for each offense.</p>
