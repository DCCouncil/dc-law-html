                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> <span class="level-heading">Affordability. —</span> The minimum affordability level shall be determined pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-832.html">10-832</a>(c), and shall remain in effect for not less than 10 years for property offered for sale to the public and not less than 40 years for property offered for rental to the public. More points shall be awarded for proposing to develop additional affordable single-household dwelling units (that is units not counted toward the minimum affordability level); greater levels of affordability (that is affordable to a household earning 60% or less of the area median income); or for longer periods of affordability (that is for longer than the minimum period of affordability). (20 points).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> <span class="level-heading">Level of LSDBE involvement. —</span> Pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-833.html">10-833</a>(a)(2), a person submitting a winning proposal will be required to enter into an LSDBE MOU.
