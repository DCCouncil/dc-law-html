The request shall also constitute a certification that the requesting jurisdiction has complied with all procedural due process requirements that apply to the case.</p>

The term “high-volume automated administrative enforcement”, as used in this section, means the use of automated data processing to search various data bases to determine whether information is available regarding a parent who owes a child support obligation.</p>
