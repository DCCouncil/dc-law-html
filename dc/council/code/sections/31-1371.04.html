The board of directors shall review and assess the insurer’s technical investment and administrative capabilities and expertise before adopting a written plan concerning an investment strategy or investment practice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Investments acquired and held under this chapter shall be acquired and held under the supervision and direction of the board of directors of the insurer. The board of directors shall evidence by formal resolution, at least annually, that it has determined whether all investments have been made in accordance with delegations, standards, limitations, and investment objectives prescribed by the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors charged with the responsibility to direct its investments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> On no less than a quarterly basis, and more often if considered appropriate, an insurer’s board of directors, or committee of the board of directors, shall:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Review and revise, as appropriate, the written plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> In discharging its duties under this section, the board of directors shall require that records of an authorization or approval, other documentation as the board of directors may require, and the report of an action taken under authority delegated under the plan referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be made available on a regular basis to the board of directors.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> In discharging their duties under this section, the directors of an insurer shall perform their duties in good faith and with that degree of care that ordinarily prudent individuals in like positions would use under similar circumstances.</p>
