                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Accumulated annual leave to the credit of each officer and member of such Firefighting Division shall be adjusted by applying a four fifths factor so that each officer and member of such Firefighting Division shall be given credit for four fifths of a day of leave for each day of such accumulated annual leave, and thereafter accumulated annual leave credited to him pursuant to §§ 6301 to 6305 and 6307 to 6311 of Title 5, United States Code, shall be similarly adjusted when an officer or member is transferred to the Firefighting Division from another agency or from another division of the Fire Department.</p>
