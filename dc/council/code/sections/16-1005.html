In determining visitation arrangements, if the judicial officer finds that an intrafamily offense has occurred, the judicial officer shall only award visitation if the judicial officer finds that the child and custodial parent can be adequately protected from harm inflicted by the other party.

Upon conviction, criminal contempt shall be punished by a fine of not more than the amount set forth in [§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/22-3571.01.html">22-3571.01</a>] or imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or both.</p>
