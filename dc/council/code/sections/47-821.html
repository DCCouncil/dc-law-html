                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The Mayor shall assess all real property, identifying separately the value of land and improvements thereon, and administer and collect the real property tax within the District. The Mayor shall also notify owners of real property of assessments and of appeal procedures. In addition, he shall maintain adequate records relating to the administration of the real property tax in the District, and provide appropriate public information concerning such tax.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Mayor shall appoint assessors competent to determine values of real property to carry out the provisions of §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-820.html">47-820</a> to 47-828 and other relevant portions of this chapter. Each person so appointed shall take and subscribe an oath to diligently, faithfully, and impartially assess all real property according to applicable law and regulations and otherwise perform the duties of office.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor shall assure that information regarding the characteristics of real property, sales and exchanges of all such property, building permits, land use plans, and any other information pertinent to the assessment process shall be made available to the assessors on a timely basis.</p>

If an owner of real property in the District of Columbia fails to submit such information within the time and in the form prescribed, there shall be added to the real property tax levied upon the property in question for the next ensuing tax year the amount of 10% of said tax; provided, that when such information is provided after said time and it is shown that the failure to provide it was due to reasonable cause, no such addition shall be made to the tax.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or under a court order, an officer, former officer, employee, or former employee of the District may not open valuation records for public inspection or reveal any information contained in valuation records.

                  <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> An official of the District of Columbia executive branch acting in his official capacity, having a right thereto in his official capacity; provided, that no official shall inspect or use, in any review or appeal under this chapter, any information provided to the Mayor under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-820.html">47-820</a>(d) [(d) repealed] or this section, other than information provided to the Mayor for the real property under review or appeal; provided further, that nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> Prohibit the use by the official, in reviews or appeals, of statistical data in a form which ensures that the identification of a particular real property shall not be disclosed. The particular valuation records therefrom shall not be divulged or made known; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> Prohibit the official from offering any information of the subject real property provided to defend the assessment of the subject real property in a review or appeal under this chapter.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> A violation of this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine of not more than the amount set forth in [§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/22-3571.01.html">22-3571.01</a>], by imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or both.
