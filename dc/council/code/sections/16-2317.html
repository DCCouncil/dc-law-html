The Court may not make a finding of neglect based solely on a finding that a child is born addicted or dependent on a controlled substance or has a significant presence of a controlled substance in his or her system at birth. If the Division finds that —</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> in the case of a delinquency petition, that the allegations have not been established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt; or</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> in the case of a need of supervision or neglect petition, that the allegations have not been established by the preponderance of the evidence,</p><p>the Division shall dismiss the petition and order the child released from any detention or shelter care or other restriction previously ordered.

The Division may postpone a dispositional hearing to await the predisposition study and report of the Director of Social Services (in delinquency or need of supervision cases) or of the Director of the Child and Family Services Agency (in neglect cases) as required by section 16-2319  . There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a finding of the commission of an act which would constitute a criminal offense if committed by an adult is sufficient to sustain a finding of need for care or rehabilitation in delinquency and need of supervision cases.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> If the Division finds that the child is not in need of care and rehabilitation, it shall terminate the proceedings and discharge the child from detention, shelter care, or other restriction previously ordered.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Determinations of whether a child is in need of care or rehabilitation may only be made at or after the dispositional hearing, except that the Division may dismiss the petition and terminate proceedings, after giving the Corporation Counsel a reasonable opportunity to initiate commitment proceedings pursuant to Chapter 5 or 11 of Title 21, if the Division finds that the respondent is incompetent to proceed and that there is not a substantial probability that the respondent will attain competency in the reasonably foreseeable future.
