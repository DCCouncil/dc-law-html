              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Except as otherwise provided in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2403.html">47-2403</a>, a tax is levied and imposed on the sale or possession on all cigarettes in the District of Columbia at the rate of $0.125 for each cigarette.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection and in lieu of the tax otherwise imposed by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2002.html">47-2002</a>, a surtax is levied and imposed on the sale or possession of all cigarettes in the District at the rate of $0.36 per package of 20 or fewer cigarettes. If there are more than 20 cigarettes in the package, the surtax per pack will be incrementally increased by $.018 per each cigarette above 20.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Beginning as of March 31, 2012, and on March 31st of each year thereafter, the Mayor shall calculate the average retail price of a package of cigarettes from the best information available and shall recompute the surtax on the basis of the then applicable sales and use tax rate that otherwise would be applicable to the sale of cigarettes under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2002.html">47-2002</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> In calculating the average retail price for purposes of this paragraph, the Mayor shall exclude the current surtax imposed by this section and the portion of the presumptive wholesale and retail markup imposed by Chapter 45A of Title 28 of the District of Columbia Official Code on the current surtax. The Mayor shall provide notice of any change in the amount of the surtax on or before September 1st of that year, and the change shall be effective as of the following October 1st.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Cigarettes on which the taxes levied and imposed by this section have been paid shall not be subject to additional taxation under this section; provided, that the burden of proof that the taxes levied and imposed by this section have been paid shall be upon the person who sells or possesses cigarettes in the District, against whom a tax assessment has been made, who has submitted an application for a refund, or whose cigarettes have been seized. For the purposes of this section, the term “person” includes any officer or employee of a corporation responsible for payment of the tax, or any member of a partnership or association responsible for the payment of the tax.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The tax levied and imposed by this section shall be paid by the affixture of stamps, purchased from the Mayor, evidencing the payment of the amount of tax imposed by this section. Such stamps shall be affixed to the original packages of cigarettes included in the directory of Tobacco Product Manufacturers maintained pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1803.03.html">7-1803.03</a>(b) and shall be cancelled in the manner prescribed by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, each licensed wholesaler shall affix a stamp or stamps, evidencing the payment of the amount of tax imposed by this section, to each original package of cigarettes to be kept for sale, offered for sale, displayed for sale, or sold within the District. Such stamps shall be affixed to each original package of such cigarettes within 72 hours after the receipt of such cigarettes and prior to the sale of such cigarettes unless such cigarettes are exempt from taxation under the provisions of this chapter. Whenever any cigarettes are found in the place of business of a licensed wholesaler without the stamps affixed as herein provided, or not segregated or marked as having been received within the preceding 72 hours, or not segregated or marked as being held for sale outside of the limits of the District, or not segregated or marked as being held for sale to the United States or the District government, or any instrumentalities thereof, or not segregated or marked for other exempt purposes under this chapter, a prima facie presumption shall arise that such cigarettes are subject to the tax levied and imposed by this section and are possessed in violation of the provisions of this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Licensed retailers and vending machine operators shall not accept deliveries of unstamped or improperly stamped cigarettes. Such licensees shall examine all packages of cigarettes immediately upon their receipt and shall immediately return any and all unstamped or improperly stamped cigarettes to the licensed wholesaler. Unless substantial evidence to the contrary is shown, the possession of any unstamped or improperly stamped cigarettes by such licensees shall be prima facie evidence that such cigarettes are possessed in violation of the provisions of this chapter. The Mayor may, however, authorize licensed retailers and vending machine operators to acquire and have in their possession cigarettes bearing cigarette tax stamps issued by any other state or jurisdiction; provided, that such cigarettes are intended for sale in such other state or jurisdiction. Licensed retailers and vending machine operators shall not purchase, acquire, or have in their possession District tax stamps. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, licensed retailers or vending machine operators, other than licensed retailers or vending machine operators who are also licensed wholesalers, who either have in their possession unused cigarette tax stamps or unstamped cigarettes on the effective date of this chapter shall not be deemed in violation of this subsection; provided, that such licensed retailers and vending machine operators affix or redeem such unused cigarette tax stamps and pay the tax levied and imposed by this section on such unstamped cigarettes in the manner and within the time specified by the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> On sales of cigarettes to other licensed wholesalers, a licensed wholesaler may deliver such cigarettes without affixing stamps thereon, and such other licensed wholesalers shall be liable for the tax imposed by this section on such cigarettes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> All packages of cigarettes placed in cigarette vending machines shall be placed in such manner that the District cigarette tax stamps are visible whenever the packages are within that area of the vending machine which permits visibility of the packages.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> Except as authorized by this section or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2403.html">47-2403</a>, no person shall willfully or knowingly sell, transfer, buy, receive, have in his possession, or offer to sell, transfer, buy, or receive any unstamped or improperly stamped cigarettes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> No person shall sell, transfer, or offer to sell or transfer any cigarette tax stamps to any person other than the Mayor; nor shall any person buy, receive or offer to buy or receive any cigarette tax stamps from any person other than the Mayor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The Mayor may by regulation provide for the purchase of stamps at a discount not exceeding 10% of the face value of such stamps.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> The taxes imposed under this section shall be deemed to be a part of the selling price of cigarettes and shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any taxes imposed by any other law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> There is established as a special fund the Smoking Cessation Fund (“Fund”), which shall be administered by the Department of Health in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> There shall be deposited into the Fund:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Such funds as may be appropriated from time to time; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Interest earned on money deposited into the Fund.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Fund shall be used for smoking-cessation efforts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Repealed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The money deposited into the Fund, and interest earned, shall not revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of a fiscal year, or at any other time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Subject to authorization by Congress, any funds appropriated in the Fund shall be continually available without regard to fiscal year limitation.</p>
