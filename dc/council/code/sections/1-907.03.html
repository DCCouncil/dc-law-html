                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> On the basis of the most recent determinations made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the enrolled actuary shall certify to the Retirement Board each year, at a time specified by the Retirement Board, the following information for the next fiscal year with respect to each separate fund comprising the Funds:</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor shall transmit the estimates of the actuary to the Retirement Board, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Council, and the change in benefits shall not become effective until the end of a 30-day period of review, which shall begin on the date that the 3 required transmittals have been effected.</p>
