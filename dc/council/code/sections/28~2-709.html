                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>1981 Ed., § 28:2-709.</p>
                <p>1973 Ed., § 28:2-709.</p>
                <h4>Section References</h4>
                <p>This section is referenced in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-703.html">28:2-703</a>.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</strong> Section 63, Uniform Sales Act.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> Rewritten, important commercially needed changes being incorporated.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes of Changes:</strong> To make it clear that:</p>
                <p>1. Neither the passing of title to the goods nor the appointment of a day certain for payment is now material to a price action.</p>
                <p>2. The action for the price is now generally limited to those cases where resale of the goods is impracticable except where the buyer has accepted the goods or where they have been destroyed after risk of loss has passed to the buyer.</p>
                <p>3. This section substitutes an objective test by action for the former “not readily resalable” standard. An action for the price under subsection (1)(b) can be sustained only after a “reasonable effort to resell” the goods “at reasonable price” has actually been made or where the circumstances “reasonably indicate” that such an effort will be unavailing.</p>
                <p>4. If a buyer is in default not with respect to the price, but on an obligation to make an advance, the seller should recover not under this section for the price as such, but for the default in the collateral (though coincident) obligation to finance the seller. If the agreement between the parties contemplates that the buyer will acquire, on making the advance, a security interest in the goods, the buyer on making the advance has such an interest as soon as the seller has rights in the agreed collateral. See  Section 9-204.</p>
                <p>5. “Goods accepted” by the buyer under subsection (1)(a) include only goods as to which there has been no justified revocation of acceptance, for such a revocation means that there has been a default by the seller which bars his rights under this section. “Goods lost or damaged” are covered by the section on risk of loss. “Goods identified to the contract” under subsection (1)(b) are covered by the section on identification and the section on identification notwithstanding breach.</p>
                <p>6. This section is intended to be exhaustive in its enumeration of cases where an action for the price lies.</p>
                <p>7. If the action for the price fails, the seller may nonetheless have proved a case entitling him to damages for non-acceptance. In such a situation, subsection (3) permits recovery of those damages in the same action.</p>
