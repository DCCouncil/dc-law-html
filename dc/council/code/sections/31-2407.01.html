                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> A statement that under the law the claimant’s insurer has 60 days to either:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(A)">(A)</span> Preserve its subrogation rights against the tortfeasor by providing written notice of its intention to do so and by paying to the claimant an amount equal to the policy limits that have been offered to the claimant by the tortfeasor’s insurer; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)(B)">(B)</span> Allow the claimant to accept the settlement offer from the torfeasor’s insurer and execute appropriate releases.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The notice of claimant’s insurer is not effective unless the notice to the claimant is accompanied by payment to the claimant of an amount equal to the policy limits offered by the tortfeasor’s insurer.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)(B)">(B)</span> Any consent to settle or waiver of subrogation by the claimant’s insurer may not be construed to limit the right of the claimant’s insurer to raise any issue or defense relating to liability and damages in an action against the claimant’s insurer and does not constitute an admission by the claimant’s insurer as to any issue, claim, or defense raised in an action against the claimant’s insurer.</p>

The payment by the claimant’s insurer of the amount equal to the policy limits offered by the tortfeasor’s insurer shall not serve in any way to waive, change, or increase the amount of the claimant’s underinsured motorist coverage beyond the underlying underinsured motorist coverage policy limits.</p>
