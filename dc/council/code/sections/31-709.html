                <h4>Emergency Legislation</h4>
                <p>For temporary amendment of section, see § 9(c) of the Insurance Omnibus Emergency Amendment Act of 1995 (D.C. Act 11-48, May 15, 1995,  42 DCR 2544) and § 8(c) of the Insurance Omnibus Congressional Recess Emergency Amendment Act of 1995 (D.C. Act 11-97, July 19, 1995,  42 DCR 3844).</p>

                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p>Because of the codification of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/11-159.html">D.C. Law 11-159</a> as subchapter II of Chapter 37 of Title 35 [subchapter II of Chapter 7 of Title 31, 2001 Ed.], and the designation of the preexisting text as subchapter I, “subchapter” has been substituted for “chapter” throughout the section.</p>
