A District credit union merging with another District credit union may do so regardless of whether the credit unions serve the same field of membership.</p>

All participating credit unions, other than the continuing or new credit union, shall be designated as merging credit unions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> When a District credit union merges with one or more foreign credit unions or federal credit unions, the District credit union shall be subject to all applicable local and federal laws and regulations governing the chartering jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> To merge, participating credit unions shall prepare a merger plan. The merger plan which has been approved by a majority of the directors of all of the participating credit unions shall be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities for preliminary approval by the regulatory authority. If the merger plan includes the creation of a new credit union, all documents required by <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/titles/26/chapters/5/subchapters/I/">this subchapter</a> for the chartering of a new District credit union shall be submitted as part of the merger plan.

Members shall be provided written notice of the meeting, which shall state the purpose of the meeting, at least 10 days but not more than 30 days prior to the meeting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> If a majority of the voting members approve the merger plan, the District credit union shall submit a record of that fact to the Commissioner, indicating the vote by which the members approved the merger plan and copies of the notices provided to members, including copies of the membership meeting notice and mail or electronic ballot if the vote was conducted by mail or electronic means.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The Commissioner shall approve a merger plan after determining that the requirements of subsection (d) of this section have been met.

The Commissioner shall notify all participating credit unions of the Commissioner's action on the merger plan.</p>

All property, property rights, and members' interests in each merging credit union shall vest in the continuing or new credit union, as applicable, without deed, endorsement, or other instrument of transfer. All debts, obligations, and liabilities of each merging credit union shall be deemed to have been assumed by the continuing or new credit union. The rights and privileges of the members of each merging credit union shall remain intact. If a person is a member of more than one of the participating credit unions that person shall be entitled to only one set of membership rights in the continuing or new credit union.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> If the continuing or new credit union is chartered by another state or territory of the United States, it shall be subject to the requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/26-502.10.html">§ 26-502.10</a>.</p>
