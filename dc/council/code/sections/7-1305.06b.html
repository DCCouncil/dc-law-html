The administrative procedures established by DDS shall be consistent with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The panel shall be comprised of 3 members. The members of the panel and their employers shall be immune from suit for any claim arising from any good faith act or omission under this section. The members of the panel shall not be affiliated with the individual, the provider, or the physician seeking to administer the medication, but shall include:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A board-certified psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A licensed professional; and</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> An individual, or, if unavailable, an advocate for a person with an intellectual disability or other individual advocate.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The administrative procedure established by DDS for the panel shall include, at a minimum:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A meeting by the panel no later than one week after DDS receives a request for consent;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Written and oral notice to the individual not less than 48 hours prior to when the panel will meet;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The right of the individual to be present when the panel meets and to have a representative present during any such meeting;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The opportunity, at the meeting of the panel, for the individual and his or her representative to present information and to discuss the wishes of the individual;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The issuance of a written decision by the panel no later than one week after the meeting of the panel, to be provided to the individual, the individual’s representative, and the provider; and</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The right of the individual to request that the DDS Human Rights Advisory Committee or its successor entity review the decision of the panel.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If the individual requests a review by the DDS Human Rights Advisory Committee or its successor entity before the decision of the panel has been implemented, the decision shall not be implemented until after the DDS Human Rights Advisory Committee or its successor entity responds to the requested review. The DDS Human Rights Advisory Committee or its successor entity shall conduct the review at its next meeting or no later than 30 days after the request, whichever is earlier, and shall issue a response promptly.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The panel shall issue a written decision which may grant, refuse, or withdraw consent to the prescription of the proposed psychotropic medication.

If the panel grants consent, the consent shall be granted for a limited period of time and shall last no longer than 9 consecutive months.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> For individuals for whom the panel has provided consent, DDS shall offer the individual the opportunity to execute a durable power of attorney in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-2205.html">21-2205</a> and shall continue to seek to identify one or more individuals listed in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-2210.html">21-2210</a>(a) who may be reasonably available, mentally capable, and willing to act.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> For individuals for whom the panel has provided consent for 3 or more consecutive months, and for whom there is a reasonable likelihood that no decision-maker will become available and that the individual will not achieve capacity during the next 6 months to make decisions regarding psychotropic medications on his or her own behalf, the District shall petition the Court for appointment of a guardian pursuant to Chapter 20 of Title 21. The District’s petition shall request the type of guardianship which is least restrictive to the incapacitated individual in duration and scope, taking into account the incapacitated individual’s current mental and adaptive limitations or other conditions warranting the procedure. This subsection does not preclude any other party from petitioning the Court for appointment of a guardian.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> Refusal to consent to psychotropic medications shall not be used as evidence of an individual’s incapacity.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Refusal to consent to services on the basis of a valid religious objection shall not be overridden absent a specific court order requiring the provision of services.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
