of this chapter to prevent double taxation or double deduction.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The income of each member of the combined group shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> For any member incorporated in the United States, or included in a consolidated federal corporate income tax return, the income to be included in the total income of the combined group shall be the taxable income for the corporation after making appropriate adjustments under this chapter.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span
