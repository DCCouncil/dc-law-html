                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> To the parents, if there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner, or child, as follows:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Twenty percent, if 1 parent was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death and the other was not dependent to any extent;</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A surviving spouse or domestic partner dies, remarries, or enters into a domestic partnership;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A child, brother, sister, or grandchild dies, marries or enters into a domestic partnership, or becomes 18 years of age or, if over age 18 and incapable of self-support, becomes capable of self-support; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> A parent or grandparent dies, marries or enters into a domestic partnership, or ceases to be dependent.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, compensation payable to or for a child, a brother or sister, or grandchild that would otherwise end because the child, brother or sister, or grandchild has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he or she is a student as defined by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-623.01.html">1-623.01</a> at the time he or she reaches 18 years of age for so long as he or she continues to be such a student or until he or she marries.

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Seventy-five percent of the maximum monthly rate of basic pay for GS-15 as provided in § 5332 of Title 5 of the United States Code or its equivalent as provided in subchapter XI of this chapter for employees hired before January 1, 1980, or for employees who have a claim for compensation for disability pending on December 29, 1994, or 73% of the maximum monthly rate of basic pay for DS-12, Step 10 for employees hired after December 31, 1979, who make a claim for compensation for disability after December 29, 1994.</p>
