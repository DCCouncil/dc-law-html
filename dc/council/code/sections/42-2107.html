Commercial, single-family and small multi-family dwellings shall be sold at prices determined by the Mayor after considering the income level of the purchaser, the condition of the property, and such other factors as the Mayor deems appropriate pursuant to rules. In transferring single-family dwellings with one dwelling unit, priority shall be given first to the sale to a low-income person and priority shall be given next to the sale for the development of rental units for low-income persons.

Those individuals who do not elect to purchase shall have the right to relocation assistance, consistent with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-3403.02.html">42-3403.02</a>.
