Members of the staff of the Mayor or persons whose selection might create a conflict of interest, such as grocers or landlords, shall not be selected as payees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The adult recipient shall be given the opportunity for a fair hearing with respect to any decision to make or continue protective payments or the selection of the payee.</p>
