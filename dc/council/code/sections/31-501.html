                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Credit shall be allowed under subsections (d) or (e) of this section only if the applicable requirements of subsection (h) of this section have been satisfied.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited by the Commissioner of the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking (“Commissioner”) as a reinsurer in the District. To be eligible for accreditation, a reinsurer shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> File with the Commissioner evidence of its submission to the District’s jurisdiction;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> File annually with the Commissioner a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million and its accreditation has not been denied by the Commissioner within 90 days after submission of its application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled in, or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this statute, and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The requirement of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.</p>

To enable the Commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the Commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement form by licensed insurers. The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the Commissioner and bear the expense of the examination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted under this subsection unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by the commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled or the commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(B)">(B)</span> The form of the trust and any trust amendments shall also be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer’s United States ceding insurers, their assigns, and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the Commissioner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(C)">(C)</span> The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. No later than February 28 of each year, the trustee of the trust shall report to the Commissioner in writing the balance of the trust and a listing of the trust’s investments as of December 31 of the preceding year and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire before December 31 of that year.</p>

The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows and shall consider all material risk factors, including, when applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer’s liquidity or solvency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> The minimum required trusteed surplus shall not be reduced to an amount of less than 30% of the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the group’s respective underwriters’ several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(A)(iii)">(iii)</span> In addition to these trusts, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100 million shall be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(B)">(B)</span> The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)(C)">(C)</span> Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the Commissioner an annual certification by the group’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if a certification is unavailable, financial statements prepared by independent public accountants of each underwriter member of the group.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)(A)">(A)</span> Have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least 3 years immediately before making application for accreditation;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> An association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, may be a certified reinsurer.

A qualified jurisdiction must agree to share information and cooperate with the Commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the Commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards.
