Such agreements shall continue in effect for the 5-year period commencing on such date, unless the agreement provides for a shorter duration or the parties agree to the contrary before the expiration of that 5-year period. Such agreements shall be renegotiated during the 5-year period, unless the parties agree otherwise. Any labor-management negotiation impasse declared before the date the lease takes effect shall be settled in accordance with Chapter 71 of Title 5, United States Code.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The arrangements made pursuant to this section shall assure, during the 50-year lease term, the continuation of all collective bargaining rights enjoyed by transferred employees retained by the Airports Authority.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Any transferred employee whose employment with the Airports Authority is terminated during the 5-year period beginning on the date the lease under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1004.html">9-1004</a> takes effect shall be entitled, as a condition of any lease entered into in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1004.html">9-1004</a>, to rights and benefits to be provided by the Airports Authority that are similar to those such employee would have had under federal law if termination had occurred immediately before such date.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Any employee who transfers to the Airports Authority under this section shall not be entitled to lump-sum payment for unused annual leave under 5 U.S.C. § 5551, but shall be credited by the Airports Authority with the unused annual leave balance on the date the lease under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/9-1004.html">9-1004</a> takes effect, along with any unused sick leave balance on such date.
