The proposed small area action plans may include specific zoning recommendations, capital improvements requirements, financing strategies, special tax, design, or other regulatory recommendations, and implementation techniques necessary for the realization of objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Mayor shall make copies of each proposed small area action plan available to each affected Advisory Neighborhood Commission and make ample copies of each proposed small area plan available to the Council and the public. Each proposed small area action plan shall include small area maps that depict land use policies at the small area level that are not inconsistent with the adopted generalized District-wide land use maps or approved ward plans.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Mayor shall hold a public hearing on each proposed small area action plan in the appropriate area, not less than 30 days after the publication of the proposed small area action plan and not more than 90 days after the publication of the proposed small area action plan.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Not more than 60 days after the completion of the public hearing required by this subsection, the Mayor shall transmit the revised small area action plan to the Council, with a proposed resolution, for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. The transmission shall include copies of the Mayor’s public hearing records, and an executive summary that identifies the differences, and the rationale for the differences, between the revised small area action plan and the proposed small area action plan that had been the subject of a public hearing. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the revised small area action plan, in whole or in part, by resolution within this 45-day review period, the revised small area plan shall be deemed approved. Once approved, the small area action plan shall provide supplemental guidance to the Zoning Commission and other District agencies in carrying out the policies of the Comprehensive Plan.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Small area action plans shall be prepared for selected geographical areas, including, but not limited to, the following areas:</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iv)</span> Encourage small-business incubators and plazas for licensed market vendors in order to increase business opportunities for residents; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(v)</span> Support low-impact mixed-use of residential space for multicultural arts, crafts, and other professional and consulting services;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The Southwest Urban Renewal Area and other urban renewal areas to ensure that appropriate zoning plans for these areas continue to be developed in consultation with affected citizens, which shall be implemented in phases immediately upon the termination of the various sections of the urban renewal plans; and</p>
