                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The security interest is a purchase-money security interest;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Factory or office machines;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The security interest is:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Perfected pursuant to a statute described in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/28:9-311.html">28:9-311</a>(a)(2).</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The priority of the security interest under subsection (f)(2) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor’s right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property.</p>
