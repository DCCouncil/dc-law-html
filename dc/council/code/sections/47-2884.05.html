If the Mayor does not so find after investigation he shall notify the applicant thereof and return the bond filed with the application. Within 60 days from the date of filing the application for license, accompanied by the investigation fee and bond required by this part, the Mayor shall either issue or refuse to issue such license, but no applicant shall be denied a license until after a due hearing by the Mayor, at which the applicant shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to produce evidence in support of his application. If the application be denied, the Mayor shall within 20 days thereafter prepare a written decision and findings with respect thereto containing a summary of the evidence and the reasons supporting the denial and forthwith serve upon the applicant a copy thereof.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Each license issued under this part shall state fully the name of the licensee and the place at which the business is to be conducted under such license. Such license shall be kept conspicuously posted in such place of business. No such license shall be transferable or assignable. Not more than 1 place of business shall be maintained under the same license, but the Mayor may issue more than 1 license to the same licensee upon compliance for each such license with all the provisions of this part applicable to the original issuance of licenses. Whenever a licensee shall desire to change his place of business to another location within the District he shall file an application for a new license in accordance with the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-2884.03.html">47-2884.03</a>.</p>
