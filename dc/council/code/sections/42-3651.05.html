The monitoring shall continue until the Court, on its own motion or that of any party:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Dismisses the petition on grounds that the respondent has completed the plan; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Does not exceed the value of the rental housing accommodation and its furnishings, records, and other related personal property and goods; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> Unless the Court directs otherwise, the receiver may pay the premium of the bond from the rental housing accommodation’s income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> The bond requirement of this subsection may be waived by the Court for good cause.</p>
