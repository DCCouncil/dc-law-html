Except as specifically provided in this chapter, the Authority shall be subject to all general laws applicable to public employers in the District of Columbia, including laws concerning human rights, wages and hours, and occupational safety and health.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If the Authority applies to the PERB for review of an arbitration award in accordance with § <cite path="§1-605.02">1-605.02</cite> and the PERB denies review, the PERB shall enter an order requiring the Authority to comply with the award and the Authority shall be liable to the labor organization for its litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, in connection with the arbitration proceedings and the proceedings before the PERB. If the labor organization prevails in any subsequent litigation brought by the Authority with respect to the same award, the Authority shall be liable to the labor organization for its litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, in connection with the litigation.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> Notwithstanding the provisions of Unit A of Chapter 14 of Title 2, each qualified District resident applicant shall receive an additional 10-point preference over a qualified non-District resident applicant for all positions within the Authority unless the applicant declines the preference. This 10-point preference shall be in addition to, and not instead of, qualifications established for the position. All persons hired after February 6, 2008, shall submit proof of residency upon employment in a manner determined by the Board. An applicant claiming the hiring preference under this section shall agree in writing to maintain bona fide District residency for a period of 7 consecutive years from the effective date of hire and shall provide proof of such residency annually to the director of personnel of the Authority for the first 7 years of employment. Failure to maintain District residency for the consecutive 7-year period shall result in forfeiture of employment. The Authority shall submit to the Mayor and the Council annual reports detailing the names of all new employees and their pay schedules, titles, and place of residence.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
