                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> If a consumer has been certified as incapacitated for purposes of making a health care decision in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/21-2204.html">21-2204</a>, his or her attorney-in-fact or substitute health care decision-maker may consent to the administration of medication only in accordance with the consumer’s treatment preferences as expressed in his or her durable power of attorney for health care or declaration of advance instructions for mental health treatment. This preference may be overridden only after the procedures set forth in subsection (c) of this section are followed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Except in an emergency or in the absence of an attorney-in-fact or substitute health care decision-maker who is available and willing to make a decision about the administration of medication for the purpose of mental health treatment, a provider may administer medication to the incapacitated consumer only after receiving approval for such action through an administrative procedure established by the Department in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 2.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(8)">(8)</span> The right to have any decision of a neutral party that is appealed to the panel stayed pending a determination by the panel regarding whether the decision should stand or be overturned.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> A consumer’s refusal to consent to medication on the basis of a valid religious objection shall not be overridden absent a specific court order requiring the provider to administer the medication.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Family members and personal representatives to whom the consumer has authorized release of information in accordance with Chapter 12 of this title, shall be notified whenever a provider involuntarily administers medication pursuant to subsections (c) or (d) of this section.</p>
