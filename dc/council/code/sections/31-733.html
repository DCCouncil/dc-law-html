The incorporators shall promptly file such endorsed articles of incorporation with the D.C. Office of Corporations. The endorsed articles of incorporation shall be deemed effective as of the effective date of a reorganization accomplished pursuant to this act [this subchapter], upon the filing of the articles with the D.C.

Upon adoption of an amendment, the mutual holding company shall make under its corporate seal a certificate thereof, setting forth the amendment and the date and manner of the adoption thereof, which certificate shall be executed by the mutual insurance holding company’s president or vice president and secretary or assistant secretary, and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take acknowledgments. The mutual insurance holding company shall deliver the originals of the certificate to the Commissioner and Corporation Counsel. The Commissioner and Corporation Counsel shall promptly examine the certificate of amendment, and, if the Commissioner and Corporation Counsel find that the certificate and the amendment comply with law, the Commissioner and Corporation Counsel shall endorse their approvals upon each of the originals, place one on file in the Commissioner’s office, and return the remaining sets to the mutual insurance holding company. The mutual insurance holding company shall promptly file such endorsed certificates of amendment with the D.C. Office of Corporations. The D.C. Office of Corporations shall accept the endorsed certificates of amendment without further review or approval. The amendment shall be effective when filed with the D.C. Office of Corporations.</p>
