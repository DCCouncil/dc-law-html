The CFO is authorized to include this pledge and agreement of the District as part of the contract with the holders of any of its bonds.

Neither the bond order, trust agreement, nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded or filed under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code to be valid, binding, and effective against the parties.</p>
