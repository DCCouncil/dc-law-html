                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> A retail dealer shall have the right to terminate or repudiate any marketing agreement to which he is a party for any reason, without the imposition of any damages or penalties and without any recourse by the distributor for such termination or repudiation, within 7 days, not including Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays, after the day on which performance of such marketing agreement commences. For purposes of this subsection, the term “marketing agreement” shall not include any renewal, extension, modification, amendment, or novation of an existing marketing agreement. For purposes of this subsection, the term “performance” shall mean the granting of a present right, privilege, or authority to use a trademark, the granting of a present right, privilege, or authority to occupy a retail service station, or the actual delivery of any motor fuels, petroleum products, or automotive products to the retail dealer. In order to exercise his right to terminate or repudiate a marketing agreement pursuant to this subsection, the retail dealer shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Mail written notice, by registered or certified mail, to the distributor of his intention to exercise his right under this subsection within the period specified in this subsection;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Discontinue use of any trademark presently being used by such retail dealer pursuant to the marketing agreement;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Deliver or tender, so far as is practical, to the distributor all money, equipment, and merchantable products, including all motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products which the retail dealer has not presently sold, which have been loaned, sold, or delivered to the retail dealer pursuant to the marketing agreement within 10 days after mailing the notice specified in this subsection; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(D)">(D)</span> Deliver or tender to the distributor full possession of any retail service station provided by the distributor pursuant to the marketing agreement within 10 days after mailing the notice specified in this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The retail dealer shall receive full credit, or the cash equivalent, for all money, equipment, and merchantable products delivered to the distributor pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection. Nothing contained within this subsection shall be construed as granting a similar right to terminate or repudiate to the distributor under a marketing agreement or as prohibiting the retail dealer from cancelling a marketing agreement during the period specified in this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> No retail dealer or distributor, except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section, shall terminate, cancel, or fail to renew a marketing agreement unless he furnishes prior written notice to the other party. Such notice shall be sent to the other party by registered or certified mail not less than 90 days prior to the date on which the marketing agreement is to be terminated, cancelled, or not renewed, unless a shorter period is provided for in this subsection. Such notice shall contain a statement of the party’s intention to terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the marketing agreement, the date on which such action shall become effective, and a statement of the specific grounds for such action. No distributor shall terminate, cancel, or fail to renew a marketing agreement, or notify a retail dealer of his intention to take such action, unless he reasonably and in good faith believes that the facts and circumstances existing do, in fact, justify his reliance on the grounds specified in his notice of intention to take such action. Notice furnished pursuant to this subsection shall be effective on the date of the mailing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> In the event that a termination or cancellation is based upon 1 or more of the grounds specified in paragraphs (1) through (4) and (10) through (17) of subsection (c) of this section, the 90 days advance notice shall not be required. However, in such an event, the distributor shall furnish written notice to the retail dealer as far in advance of the effective date of such termination or cancellation as is reasonably practical under the circumstances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> The distributor’s failure to furnish prior written notice, as required by this subsection, of his intention not to renew a marketing agreement, whether or not such marketing agreement provides for automatic extension or renewal, shall constitute a renewal of the marketing agreement for a term of 1 year from its stated expiration date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> No distributor shall terminate or cancel any marketing agreement with a retail dealer, either directly or indirectly, unless such termination or cancellation is based upon 1 or more of the grounds specified in this subsection.
