The reports shall contain all information the Mayor considers reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. Records necessary to comply with this reporting requirement shall be maintained in a central location at each solid waste facility for a period of time prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor may provide by rulemaking that failure to submit periodic reports or maintain records may result in the imposition of a fine of up to $25,000, suspension or revocation of a solid waste facility permit, or both.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The information contained in the periodic reports and the application shall be considered proprietary and held confidential by the District.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> All new and existing solid waste facilities holding interim and permanent operating permits pursuant to this chapter shall comply with the following operating and reporting requirements and prohibitions:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Within six months from the effective date of the Solid Waste Facility Permit Amendment Act of 1998 each solid waste facility shall develop a traffic flow plan showing the routes used by inbound and outbound vehicles to the facility from the nearest arterial roads and any other arterial roads used by inbound or outbound vehicles.  If the facility is located on an arterial road, the traffic flow plan shall encompass an area of no less than four blocks from the solid waste facility in any direction.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> No solid waste facility permit shall be issued until the traffic control plan has been assessed and approved by the Department of Public Works, which may set reasonable criteria for each plan as it deems necessary. Each solid waste facility shall submit traffic flow plans to the Department of Public Works.  Each facility shall provide notice in the District of Columbia Register, of its traffic flow plan to each Advisory Neighborhood Commission (“ANC”) adjacent to the ANC in which the solid waste facility is operating and through which any of the inbound or outbound vehicles pass through for comment, publish the plan in a newspaper of general circulation in the District of Columbia and post the complete plan at the solid waste facility for public review. ANC comments must be submitted no later than 45 days after publication.  A copy of any study, survey, professional opinion, or other materials relied upon by a solid waste facility in developing or submitting a traffic flow plan shall be provided to any requesting ANC.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The traffic flow plan shall be designed to maximize use of truck routes or other arterial traffic routes of 4 or more lanes and to minimize truck traffic on residential streets or through residential areas.   The plan shall include, at a minimum, a map designating the proposed travel routes for all trucks traveling to and from the facility and a plan for enforcement of the traffic flow plan by the facility.  Inbound vehicles shall use arterial roads except when collecting waste.
