In accordance with regulations of the Department, the adoptive parents shall be required at least annually to show that the agreement is still in force or has been renewed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Department shall consider the holder of a medical assistance identification pursuant to this section as any other holder of a medical assistance identification under the laws of the District and shall process and make payment on claims on account of such holder in the same manner and pursuant to the same conditions and procedures as for other recipients of medical assistance.</p>

To this end, the adoptive parents acting for the child may submit evidence of payment for services or benefit amounts not payable in the residence state and shall be reimbursed therefore. However, there shall be no reimbursement for services or benefit amounts covered under any insurance or other third party medical contract or arrangement held by the child or the adoptive parents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The additional coverage and benefit amounts provided pursuant to this  subsection shall be for the cost of services for which there is no federal  contribution, or which, if federally aided, are not provided by the residence  state.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The Mayor shall make regulations implementing this subsection.

A violation of this subsection shall be prosecuted by the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The provisions of this section shall apply only to medical assistance for children under adoption assistance agreements from states that have entered into a compact with the District under which the other state provided medical assistance to children with special needs under adoption assistance agreements made by the District. All other children entitled to medical assistance pursuant to adoption assistance agreements entered into by the District shall be eligible to receive it in accordance with the laws and procedures applicable thereto.</p>
