A license issued under this chapter shall not be transferable or assignable; provided, that the location of an international banking corporation office may be changed after notification of the Commissioner as required by regulation. The license shall at all times be conspicuously displayed in the place of business specified in the license.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> An international banking corporation licensed under this chapter shall, whenever its articles of incorporation are amended, immediately file with the Commissioner a copy of the amendment duly authenticated by the proper officer of the country under which the international banking corporation was organized. The filing of the amendment shall not:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Enlarge or alter the purpose for which the international banking corporation is authorized to transact banking business or representational activities in the District of Columbia;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Authorize the international banking corporation to transact banking business or representational activities in the District of Columbia in any other name than the name set forth in its license; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Extend the duration of its corporate existence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> An international banking corporation licensed under this chapter shall apply to the Commissioner to secure an amended license if it changes its corporate name, changes the duration of its corporate existence, or desires to pursue a different or additional purpose which is not set forth in its prior application for a license. The requirements with respect to the form and contents of the application, the manner of its execution, the filing of duplicate originals of the application with the Commissioner, the issuance and effect of an amended license, and the recording of the amended license shall be the same as in the case of an original application for a license.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> An international banking corporation desiring to convert an existing international banking corporation office to an international banking corporation office of a different type shall submit to the Commissioner an application on a form that the Commissioner shall prescribe, which application shall be accompanied by all of the information and documents that are required for the license sought.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> Nothing in the laws of the District of Columbia shall restrict the right of a District of Columbia-licensed international agency, international branch, or international financing corporation to convert to a federal license or charter upon compliance with the laws of the United States. Upon completion of any such conversion, the District of Columbia license shall be surrendered to the Commissioner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> An international banking corporation desiring to convert a federal international bank office or corporation organized under section 25A of the Edge Act into an international banking corporation office operating under the provisions of this chapter shall meet the minimum criteria of the District of Columbia-chartered form into which it is converting.</p>

An international branch shall have the same rights and privileges as a bank organized under the District of Columbia Banking Code, including the right to receive deposits and exercise fiduciary powers. The operations of an international branch shall be conducted under regulations determined by the Commissioner as necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the District of Columbia Banking Code. The regulations shall include requirements for the maintenance of accounts and records separate from those of the international banking corporation of which it is a branch. An application to establish an international branch shall be made under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/26-636.html">26-636</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(i)">(i)</span> Deposits of a foreign nation, an agency or instrumentality of a foreign nation, or a person who resides in, is domiciled in, and maintains its, or his or her, principal place of business in, a foreign nation. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “person” means an individual, proprietorship, joint venture, partnership, trust, business trust, syndicate, association, joint stock company, corporation, limited liability company, or any other organization (or any branch or division thereof);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> Interbank deposits, interbank borrowing, or similar interbank obligations; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)(E)">(E)</span> An international banking corporation may operate more than one international agency in the District of Columbia, each at a different place of business; provided, that each agency office shall be separately licensed to transact a banking business or any part of a banking business, under this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Subject to the provisions of this chapter, an international representative office may act in the District of Columbia in a liaison capacity with existing and potential customers of an international banking corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates. It may, through its employees or agents, solicit loans; assemble credit information; make proprietary inspections and appraisals; assist in completing loan applications and other preliminary paperwork in preparation for making a loan; administer personnel and operations; engage in data processing or recordkeeping activities; provide information to customers concerning their accounts; answer questions; receive applications for extensions of credit and other banking services; transmit documents on behalf of customers; make arrangements for customers to transact business on their accounts; service loans or extensions of credit and investments; solicit, but not accept, deposits; and engage in such other activities as the Commissioner may approve by order or regulation.
