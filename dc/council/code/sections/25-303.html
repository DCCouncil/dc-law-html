                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> No licensee under a manufacturer’s or wholesaler’s license shall hold a  license of any other class or kind.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> No licensee under an off-premises retailer’s license, class A or B, shall  hold an interest in any other license.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Board shall not reject, solely on the basis of this section, the application of a franchisee who controls, or will control, the entire interest in the receipts, profits, inventory, purchases, pricing, and sales of beverages under the license, if the franchisee held a license, or had an application for a license pending, on June 22, 1982.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The requirements of this section shall not apply to an applicant for an off-premises retailer’s license, class B, for the sale of alcoholic beverages in an establishment if:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The primary business and purpose is the sale of a full range of fresh,  canned, and frozen food items, and the sale of alcoholic beverages is  incidental to the primary purpose;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The sale of alcoholic beverages constitutes no more than 15% of the total  volume of gross receipts on an annual basis;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The establishment is located in a C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, or C-5 zone or, if located within the Southeast Federal Center, in the SEFC/C-R zone;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The establishment is a full service grocery store which is newly  constructed with a certificate of occupancy issued after January 1, 2000, or  is an existing store which has undergone renovations in excess of $500,000 after January 1, 2000;</p>

The limited partner shall not have or exercise managerial control or decision-making authority with respect to daily operations of the limited partnership. Upon a default by the general partner wholesaler, the limited partner shall not acquire or assume additional control, ownership, or financial interest in the limited partnership. The manufacturer, or its affiliate licensed in the District shall not have a financial or ownership interest in the general partner wholesaler.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The only financial assistance allowed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be the initial financial assistance to the limited partnership to acquire a licensed beer wholesaler. In that arrangement for financial assistance, the wholesaler license issued under this title shall be issued in the name of the general partner wholesaler on behalf of the limited partnership, and shall not be issued in the name of the limited partnership nor in the name of the manufacturer, or its affiliate.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The limited partnership providing the financial assistance described in this section shall not exist for more than 10 years from the date of its creation, and shall not be recreated, renewed, or extended beyond that date.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> This section shall not amend or otherwise alter this title, except for the limited purpose of allowing a manufacturer, or its affiliate, which is licensed in the District, to provide financial assistance to a limited partnership for the exclusive purpose of acquiring a licensed beer wholesaler. A manufacturer or its affiliate shall not require the wholesaler to use the financial assistance as described above.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Nothing in this section shall prohibit a wholesaler or other licensee under this title from obtaining, perfecting, or enforcing a security interest under Article 9 of Subtitle I of Title 28 in any personal property or fixtures of a retailer or other licensee, including inventory and accounts and other rights to payment.</p>
