                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> If there be a surviving spouse or domestic partner and no child of the deceased, to such surviving spouse or domestic partner 50% of the average wages of the deceased, for as long as the surviving spouse or domestic partner does not remarry or enter into a domestic partnership, with 2 years’ compensation in 1 sum upon remarriage or entry into a domestic partnership; and if there be a surviving child or children of the deceased, the additional amount of 16 2/3% of such wages for each such child; in case of the death, remarriage, or entry into a domestic partnership of such surviving spouse or domestic partner, if there be 1 surviving child of the deceased employee, such child shall have his compensation increased to 50% of such wages, and if there be more than 1 surviving child of the deceased employee to such children, in equal parts, 50% of such wages increased by 16 2/3% of such wages for each child in excess of 1; provided, that the total amount payable shall in no case exceed 66 2/3% of such wages. The Mayor may, in his discretion, require the appointment of a guardian for the purpose of receiving the compensation of a minor child.

But in no case shall the aggregate amount payable under this paragraph exceed the difference between 66 2/3% of such wages and the amount payable as herein before provided to surviving spouse or domestic partner and for the support of surviving child or children.</p>

                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/17-231.html">D.C. Law 17-231</a> substituted “surviving spouse or domestic partner” for “widow or widower” throughout the section; and rewrote par. (2), which had read as follows: “(2) If there be a widow or widower and no child of the deceased, to such widow or widower 50% of the average wages of the deceased, during widowhood, or widowerhood, with 2 years’ compensation in 1 sum upon remarriage; and if there be a surviving child or children of the deceased, the additional amount of 16 2/3% of such wages for each such child; in case of the death or remarriage of such widow or widower, if there be 1 surviving child of the deceased employee, such child shall have his compensation increased to 50% of such wages, and if there be more than 1 surviving child of the deceased employee to such children, in equal parts, 50% of such wages increased by 16 2/3% of such wages for each child in excess of 1; provided, that the total amount payable shall in no case exceed 66 2/3% of such wages. The Mayor may, in his discretion, require the appointment of a guardian for the purpose of receiving the compensation of a minor child. In the absence of such a requirement, the appointment of a guardian for such purposes shall not be necessary.”</p>
