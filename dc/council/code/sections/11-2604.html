Such attorney shall be reimbursed for expenses reasonably incurred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The compensation to be paid to an attorney appointed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed the following maximum amounts:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> For representation of a defendant before the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for misdemeanors or felonies, the maximum amount set forth in section 3006A(d)(2) of title 18, United States Code, for representation of a defendant before the United States magistrate judge or the district court for misdemeanors or felonies (as the case may be).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> For representation of a defendant before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the maximum amount set forth in section 3006A(d)(2) of title 18, United States Code, for representation of a defendant in an appellate court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> For representation of a defendant in post-trial matters for misdemeanors or felonies, the amount applicable under paragraph (1) for misdemeanors or felonies (as the case may be).</p>

Any such request for payment shall be submitted by the attorney for approval by the chief judge of the Superior Court upon recommendation of the presiding judge in the case or, in cases before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, approval by the chief judge of the Court of Appeals upon recommendation of the presiding judge in the case. Each chief judge may delegate such approval authority to an active or senior judge in the court in which the chief judge sits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> A separate claim for compensation and reimbursement shall be made to the Superior Court for representation before that court, and to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for representation before that court. Each claim shall be supported by a sworn written statement specifying the time expended, services rendered, and expenses incurred while the case was pending before the court, and the compensation and reimbursement applied for or received in the same case from any other source. The court shall fix the compensation and reimbursement to be paid to the attorney. In cases where representation is furnished other than before the Superior Court or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, claims shall be submitted to the Superior Court which shall fix the compensation and reimbursement to be paid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> For purposes of compensation and other payments authorized by this section, an order by a court granting a new trial shall be deemed to initiate a new case.</p>
