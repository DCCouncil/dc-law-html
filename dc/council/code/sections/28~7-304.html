                <p>1973 Ed., § 28:7-304.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</strong> Section 6, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> This section adds to existing legislation, which merely prohibits bills in a set in ordinary domestic trade, a statement of the legal effect of a lawfully issued set.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes of Changes:</strong> The statement of the legal effect of a lawfully issued set is in accord with existing commercial law relating to maritime and other overseas bills. This law has been codified in the Hague and Warsaw Conventions and in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the provisions of which would ordinarily govern in situations where bills in a set are recognized by this Article.</p>
                <p><strong>Cross Reference:</strong>Section 10-103.</p>
                <p><strong>Definitional Cross References:</strong> “Bailee”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Bill of lading”.  Section 7-102.</p>
                <p>“Delivery”.  Section 1-201.</p>

                <p>“Overseas”.  Section 2-323.</p>
                <p>“Person”.  Section 1-201.</p>
                <p>“Receipt of goods”.  Section 2-103.</p>
                <p><strong>Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</strong> Former  Section 7-304.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> To limit bills in a set to tangible bills of lading and to use terminology more consistent with modern usage.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes:</strong> 1. Tangible bills of lading in a set are still used in some nations in international trade. Consequently, a tangible bill of lading part of a set could be at issue in a lawsuit that might come within Article 7. The statement of the legal effect of a lawfully issued set is in accord with existing commercial law relating to maritime and other international tangible bills of lading. This law has been codified in the Hague and Warsaw Conventions and in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the provisions of which would ordinarily govern in situations where bills in a set are recognized by this Article. Tangible bills of lading in a set are prohibited in domestic trade.</p>
                <p>2. Electronic bills of lading in domestic or international trade will not be issued in a set given the requirements of control necessary to deliver the bill to another person. An electronic bill of lading will be a single, authoritative copy.  Section 7-106. Hence, this section differentiates between electronic bills of lading and tangible bills of lading. This section does not prohibit electronic data messages about goods in transit because these electronic data messages are not the issued bill of lading. Electronic data messages contain information for the carrier’s management and handling of the cargo but this information for the carrier’s use is not the issued bill of lading.</p>
                <p><strong>Cross Reference:</strong>Section 7-103,  7-303 and  7-106.</p>
                <p><strong>Definitional Cross References:</strong> “Bailee”.  Section 7-102.</p>
