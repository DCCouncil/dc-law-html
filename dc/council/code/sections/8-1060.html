The rules of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia relating to granting an injunction or restraining order shall be applicable to actions brought pursuant to this subsection, except that the District, as complaining party, shall not be required to furnish bond or security.  It shall not be necessary for the Court to find that the building, ground, premises, or place was being unlawfully used at the time of the hearing. The Court shall enter an order restraining the defendant from operating a solid waste facility in violation of this chapter, upon finding that the material allegations of  the complaint are true.  Nothing in this section shall preclude any person or class of persons, from bringing a public or private nuisance claim against a solid waste facility.</p>

In any action brought pursuant to this subsection, the court, in issuing its final order, may award costs of litigation, including reasonable expert witness and attorneys fees, to the prevailing or substantially prevailing party, whenever the court determines that an award is appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> Any person violating the provisions of this chapter, or any rule, regulation or permit issued under its authority, shall, upon conviction in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be fined no more than $1,000 or imprisoned for a period not to exceed 30 days, or both, in the discretion of the court.</p>
