The eligibility criteria are designed to qualify individuals who have a high likelihood of receiving SSI.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Applications for IDA shall be approved or disapproved by the Mayor with reasonable promptness. Other aspects of the application process, including good-cause exceptions to the application-processing standard, shall be determined by rules established by the Mayor.

The applicant shall be ineligible for IDA unless he or she:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Alleges a disabling condition different from, or in addition to, that considered by SSA in making its determination;</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Alleges more than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Social Security Act, and has not applied to SSA for a determination with respect to these allegations; or</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Alleges less than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Social Security Act, and has applied to SSA for reconsideration or reopening of its disability decision.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> For any month or period of months in which an IDA recipient receives both IDA and SSI, the IDA recipient shall repay to the District of Columbia:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The entire amount of the IDA assistance payments received if the SSI benefits received for the same period equaled or exceeded the IDA payment; or</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> That portion of the IDA assistance payments equal in amount to the SSI benefits received for the same period if the SSI benefits received were less than the IDA payment.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> To make repayment in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, an IDA applicant shall sign an Interim Assistance Reimbursement Authorization which:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Permits the Social Security Administration to send the individual’s past-due SSI benefit payment to the DHS; and</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Permits DHS to deduct from these payments an amount equal to the IDA benefits provided.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Upon receipt of an IDA recipient’s past-due SSI benefit, DHS shall calculate, in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of the benefit due to DHS as repayment and the amount, if any, due the IDA recipient.
