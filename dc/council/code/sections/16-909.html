                <p>rewrote subsec. (c) which formerly read:</p>
                <p>“(c) Upon the entry of a final judgment determining the parentage of a child by the Superior Court under the provisions of  section 16-2341 et seq.,  section 16-909(b) or by any other court of competent jurisdiction upon a genetic test result and affidavit as provided in subsection (b-1)(1) of this section, or if the father has acknowledged paternity as provided in  section 16-909.01(a), the parent-child relationship is conclusively established. A parent-child relationship that has been established pursuant to subsection (b-1)(1) of this section or  section 16-909.01(a)(1) may be challenged upon the same grounds and through the same procedures as are applicable to a final judgment of the Superior Court.”</p>
                <p>and added subsec. (c-1).</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/18-33.html">D.C. Law 18-33</a> rewrote the section.</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/18-88.html">D.C. Law 18-88</a> rewrote subsec. (a-1)(2); and, in subsec. (e)(2), inserted “A donor of semen to a person for artificial insemination, other than the donor’s spouse or domestic partner, is not a parent of a child thereby conceived unless the donor and the person agree in writing that said donor shall be a parent.”. Prior to amendment, subsec. (a-1)(2) read as follows: “(2) For a child born to a mother in a domestic partnership, there shall be a presumption that the female domestic partner of the child’s mother is a parent of the child if the mother and the mother’s domestic partner are or have been in a domestic partnership at the time of either conception or birth, or between conception and birth, and the child is born during the domestic partnership, or within 300 days after the termination of the domestic partnership pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-702.html">32-702</a>(d).”</p>
                <p>The 2013 amendment by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/19-233.html">D.C. Law 19-233</a> substituted “domestic partner or spouse” for “domestic partner” in (b)(2); and added (b-2).</p>
