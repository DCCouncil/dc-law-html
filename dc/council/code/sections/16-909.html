                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> if, after the child’s birth, he and the child’s mother marry or attempt to marry, (with the attempt involving some form of marriage ceremony that has been performed in apparent compliance with law), though such attempted marriage is or might be declared void for any reason, and he has acknowledged the child to be his; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> if the putative father has acknowledged paternity in writing.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> There shall be a presumption that a woman is the mother of a child if she and the child’s mother are or have been married, or in a domestic partnership, at the time of either conception or birth, or between conception or birth, and the child is born during the marriage or domestic partnership, or within 300 days after the termination of marital cohabitation by reason of death, annulment, divorce, or separation ordered by a court, or within 300 days after the termination of the domestic partnership pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-702.html">32-702</a>(d) or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-904.html">16-904</a>(e).</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Whether the conduct of the mother or the presumed parent should preclude that party from denying parentage;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, when a child has both a presumed parent and a parent established by a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-909.01.html">16-909.01</a>(a)(1), the Court shall determine parentage after giving due consideration to the child’s interests and the duration and stability of the relationship between the child, the presumed parent, and the acknowledged parent.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Upon a result and an affidavit from a laboratory of a genetic test of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation bodies designated by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that is performed by a laboratory approved by such a body indicating a 99% probability that the person is the genetic parent of the child; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If the father has acknowledged paternity in writing as provided in section 16-909.01(a)(1).</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The child was born in the District of Columbia;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Both individuals seeking a judgment adjudicating parentage have a legal relationship with the child through a presumption of parentage under this section or meet the requirements of parentage in subsection (e) of this section; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Both parents submit to the jurisdiction of the District by consent in a record, by entering a general appearance, or by filing a responsive document having the effect of waiving any contest to personal jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Upon the determination of parentage under this subsection, the court shall issue a judgment adjudicating the parentage of the child.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Upon a determination of the parentage of a child by the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The Superior Court of the District of Columbia under the provisions of subchapter II of Chapter 23 of this title or subsection (b) of this section;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Any other court of competent jurisdiction;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> The IV-D agency of another state, in compliance with jurisdictional and procedural requirements of that state; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Any entity of another state authorized to determine parentage, in compliance with jurisdictional and procedural requirements of that state;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> When a child has no presumed parent under subsection (a)(1) through (4) of this section or under subsection (a-1)(2) of this section, by a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity pursuant to section 16-909.01(a)(1), unless either signatory rescinds the acknowledgment pursuant to section 16-909.01(a-1); or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> By a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity in another state pursuant to the laws and procedures of that state, unless either signatory rescinds the acknowledgment pursuant to the laws and procedures of that state.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c-1)</span> A parent-child relationship that has been established pursuant to subsection (b-1)(1) of this section may be challenged upon the same grounds and through the same procedures as are applicable to a final judgment of the Superior Court. A parent-child relationship that has been established pursuant to subsection (b-1)(2) of this section or section 16-909.01(a)(1) may be challenged in the Superior Court after the rescission period provided by section 16-909.01(a-1) through the same procedures as are applicable to a final judgment of the Superior Court, but only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the challenging party. The legal responsibilities (including child support obligations) of any signatory arising from the acknowledgment of parentage may not be suspended during the challenge, except for good cause shown.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The parent-child relationship between an adoptive parent and a child may be established conclusively by proof of adoption.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A person who consents to the artificial insemination of a woman as provided in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph with the intent to be the parent of her child, is conclusively established as a parent of the resulting child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Consent by a woman, and a person who intends to be a parent of a child born to the woman by artificial insemination, shall be in writing signed by the woman and the intended parent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Failure of a person to sign a consent required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, before or after the birth of the child, shall not preclude a finding of intent to be a parent of the child if the woman and the person resided together in the same household with the child and openly held the child out as their own.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A donor of semen to a person for artificial insemination, other than the donor’s spouse or domestic partner, is not a parent of a child thereby conceived unless the donor and the person agree in writing that said donor shall be a parent. Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, genetic test results shall not establish parentage of a semen donor unless:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The donor of semen is the spouse or domestic partner of the child’s mother; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The donor and the child’s mother agree in writing that said donor shall be a parent.</p>
