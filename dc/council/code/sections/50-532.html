                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> No cancellation or refusal to renew by an insurer of a bicycle insurance policy shall be effective unless the insurer has delivered or mailed to the named insured, at the address shown in the policy or to the named insured's last known address, a written notice of intent to cancel or refusal to renew. The required notice shall be provided to the named insured at least 30 calendar days before the effective date of cancellation, or, in the case of nonrenewal, 30 calendar days before the end of the policy period. The notice shall contain a statement advising the named insured of his or her right to request, in writing, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice, that the Commissioner review the action of the insurer in cancelling or refusing to renew the policy of the insured.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Proof of mailing of the notice of cancellation, or of intention not to renew, to the named insured by post office receipt secured or certified mail at the address shown in the policy or to the named insured's last known address shall be sufficient proof of notice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Despite failure of the named insured to make timely payment of the renewal premium, failure by the insurer to provide the notice required by this section shall result in the insurer being required:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> To provide coverage for any claim that would have been covered under the policy, if the claim arises within 45 calendar days after the date within which the named insured discovers or should have discovered that his or her policy has not been renewed; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> To renew the policy upon tender of payment; provided, that tender is made within 15 calendar days after the date the named insured discovers, or should have discovered, that his or her policy has not been renewed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> No insurer shall fail or refuse to issue a policy of bicycle insurance to an applicant, fail or refuse to renew a policy of bicycle insurance, or cancel a policy of bicycle insurance in violation of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/titles/2/chapters/14/units/A/">Unit A of Chapter 14 of Title 2</a>.
