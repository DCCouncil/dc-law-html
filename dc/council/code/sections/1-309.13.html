The space shall be a minimum of 250 square feet and shall be the sole office of the Commission. The space shall be located within the Commission’s boundaries. If no such space is available, then the space shall be located within the ward boundaries of the Commission. If District-owned or leased office space cannot be provided, the Mayor may seek to reprogram funds up to $600 per month to cover the rental of office space for the respective Commission. Furnishings, equipment, telephone service, and supplies for the office space shall be provided from the Commission’s funds. There shall be a written lease between the Mayor or District agency and the Commission, which shall specify what operating costs, such as utilities, janitorial services, and security, shall be paid by the Commission.</p>

                <p>“(b) Each Commission shall by resolution designate a commercial bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or any combination thereof, which is insured by the government of the United States pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, approved September 21, 1950 (87 Stat. 873;  12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.), and which is located within the District of Columbia, as a depository of all funds received by the Commission. Each Commission shall establish no more than one checking or negotiable order of withdrawal account. The Commission may deposit into any savings account created pursuant to this section funds not immediately needed for the operation of the Commission.</p>
                <p>“(c) The treasurer of each Commission shall file with the Office of the District of Columbia Auditor, within 30 days of assuming the office of treasurer or within 30 days of any change in the requested information, on a form provided by the Auditor, a statement that includes the treasurer’s name, home and business address and telephone number, the location of the books and records of the Commission and the name and location of any depository of the Commission’s funds, including account numbers. The treasurer shall file with the District of Columbia Auditor and maintain in force during the treasurer’s occupancy of the office a cash or surety bond in an amount and on a form satisfactory to the Auditor. Participation by a Commission in the Advisory Neighborhood Commission Security Fund established by § 1-264.1 shall satisfy the requirement of a cash or surety bond. The bylaws adopted by each Commission shall include a provision for filling in a timely manner a vacancy in the office of treasurer from among the remaining Commissioners. No expenditure shall be made by a Commission during a vacancy in the office of treasurer or at any time when a current and accurate statement and bond or its equivalent are not on file with the District of Columbia Auditor.</p>
                <p>“(d) The District of Columbia Auditor shall audit the financial accounts of selected Commissions and maintain a database of financial information of each Commission for historical and expenditure trend analysis. The Auditor shall produce and submit to the Council a consolidated annual report of the financial activity of all the Commissions. The Auditor may audit the financial accounts of a Commission, at the discretion of the Auditor, upon the request by a member of the Council or a Commissioner of the Commission for which an audit is requested.</p>
                <p>“(e) Each Commission shall, by resolution, designate the location at which the Commission’s books and records shall be maintained which shall, if the Commission has a regular office, be the Commission office. The District of Columbia Auditor shall have access to the books and records of each Commission pursuant to § 47-117(c), and may issue subpoenas to banking and financial institutions requiring the production of financial documents and statements pursuant to an audit conducted under §§ 1-252 through 1-264.1. Such financial documents shall include, but not be limited to, bank statements, cancelled checks, and signature cards. The District of Columbia Auditor may apply to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for an order enforcing the subpoena. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the Superior Court as civil contempt.</p>
                <p>“(f) Any expenditure of funds by a Commission shall be authorized in writing by the treasurer or Chairman and recorded by the treasurer in the Commission’s books of accounts. No expenditure of any amount shall be made without the specific authorization of the Commission. Any expenditure made by check shall be signed by at least 2 officers of the Commission, one of whom shall be the treasurer or Chairman. The check shall, prior to signature, contain the date of payment, the name of the payee, and the amount of the payment. No check may be made payable to cash.

                <p>“(g) Disbursements of Commission funds exceeding $50 for personal service expenditures shall be specifically approved by the Commission at a public meeting prior to the disbursement. The approval shall be recorded in the minutes of the Commission meeting. Any personal services payment shall name the person who is to receive the payments, the rate of compensation, and the maximum hours of service, if less than full-time compensation. If an expenditure required to be approved pursuant to this subsection is made without the required authorization of the Commission, the expenditure shall be deemed to be a personal expense of the officer who authorized the payment, unless the Commission subsequently approves the expenditure.</p>
                <p>“(h) Each Commission may establish a petty cash fund not to exceed $50 at any one time in accordance with procedures established for imprest funds by the D.C. Controller. The fund shall be reimbursed by the treasurer upon presentation of appropriate supporting documents. The treasurer may disburse to another Commission member or employee of the Commission an amount not in excess of $50 for authorized Commission expenditures through a Commission-established petty cash fund. A record of disbursements from the petty cash fund shall be kept by the treasurer in a manner consistent with other accounts of the Commission.</p>
                <p>“(i) A Commission shall maintain its accounts on a fiscal year basis beginning October 1 and ending the following September 30.</p>

A Commission may expend its funds for public purposes outside of the Commission area as authorized pursuant to subsection (k) of this section. Expenditures may be in the form of grants by the Commission for public purposes within the Commission area pursuant to subsection (m) of this section.

                <p>“(m) A grant approved by a Commission shall provide a benefit that is public in nature and that benefits persons who reside or work within the Commission area. A grant to an individual shall be prohibited as a non-public purpose expenditure. A Commission shall adopt guidelines for the consideration and award of grants that shall include a provision that requires the proposed grantee to present the request for a grant at a public meeting of the Commission. A grant may not be awarded unless the grant is awarded pursuant to a vote of the Commission at a public meeting. The award of a grant by a Commission shall not be conditioned on support for a position taken by the Commission.</p>
                <p>“(n) The Mayor may, pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 15 of Title 1, issue rules to implement the provisions of this section. The proposed rules shall be submitted to the Council for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess.

                <p>“(p) Any Commissioner within an individual Commission shall have equal access to the Commission office in order to carry out Commission duties and responsibilities.</p>
                <p>“(q) Upon the request of a Commission, evidenced by a properly adopted resolution signed or transmitted by the Chairman and Secretary, the Mayor shall provide that Commission with suitable office space in a District-owned building. The space shall be a minimum of 250 square feet and shall be the sole office of the Commission. The space shall be located within the Commission’s boundaries. If no such space is available then the space shall be located within the ward boundaries of the Commission. Furnishings, equipment, telephone service, and supplies for the office space shall be provided from the Commission’s funds. There shall be a written lease between the Mayor or District agency and the Commission, which shall specify what operating costs, such as utilities, janitorial services, and security, shall be paid by the Commission.”</p>
