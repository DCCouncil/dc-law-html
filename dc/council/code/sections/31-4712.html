The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to such sickness as may begin more than 10 days after such date. In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.

The period of 6 months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.

Failure to furnish such proof within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than 1 year from the time proof is otherwise required.”.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(H)</span> A provision as follows:</p><p>“TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS:       Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of such loss.

Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the Commissioner may approve:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A provision as follows:</p><p>“CHANGE OF OCCUPATION:       If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the official having supervision of insurance in the jurisdiction where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such jurisdiction prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.”.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A provision as follows:</p><p>“MISSTATEMENT OF AGE:       If the age of the insured has been misstated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.”.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span><span class="level-num">(i)</span> A provision as follows:</p><p>“OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER:         If an accident or sickness or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the aggregate indemnity for . . . . . . . . . .

For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the ‘like amount’ of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.”.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase “—EXPENSE INCURRED BENEFITS.” The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of “other valid coverage,” approved as to form by the Commissioner, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other jurisdiction of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commissioner. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workmen’s compensation or employer’s liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be “other valid coverage” of which the insurer has had notice.

The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p></section></section></section></section>
