              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Every insurance company and association doing business in the District of Columbia shall, through its local agents or representatives, furnish to the Commissioner, during the month of January of each year, a statement of its business in the District, setting forth specifically the net amount of its premium receipts, the amount of losses paid, the amount of expenses incurred, respecting the business done in the District during the calendar year next preceding, and the Commissioner shall preserve a separate record of the same in his office for convenient reference, showing the ratio of such losses and expenses, respectively, to the premium receipts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Every insurance company or association of whatever kind or character, not including fraternal beneficiary associations, shall, as required by law, pay to the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue, or to a depository designated by the Director, in lieu of all other taxes, except taxes upon real estate and any license fees provided for in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-804.html">31-804</a> [repealed] an amount equal to the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> One and seven tenths percent of the gross amount of premiums received during the preceding calendar year by every life insurance company or association, not including fraternal beneficiary associations, or the gross payments or deposits collected from holders of fraternal beneficiary association certificates, on contracts of insurance covering risks resident in the District during the preceding year, including contracts for group insurance and annuities and without including or deducting any amounts received or paid for reinsurance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> In determining the gross amount of premiums to be taxed, there shall be excluded all premiums received from policies or contracts issued in connection with a pension, annuity, profit-sharing plan or individual retirement annuity qualified or exempt under §§ 401, 403, 404, 408, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or successor provisions, and all premiums returned to policyholders or annuitants during the preceding calendar year, except cash surrender values, all dividends that, during the year, have been paid in cash or applied in reduction of premiums or left to accumulate to the credit of policyholders or annuitants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> In determining the gross amount of premiums to be taxed, there shall be excluded all consideration received in connection with an annuity contract whether or not such contract is qualified or exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, and all premiums returned to policyholders or annuitants during the preceding calendar year, except cash surrender values, and all dividends that, during said year, have been paid in cash or applied in reduction of premiums or left to accumulate to the credit of policyholders or annuitants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> One and seven tenths percent of the gross amount of premiums, assessments, and fees received during the preceding calendar year by every company or association other than life on contracts of insurance other than life for business done in the District, after deducting the amount returned upon canceled policies, certificates, and rejected applications.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the premium tax shall be paid on or before March 1 of the year following the calendar year for which the tax is due.  The Commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of a company or association that fails to pay premium tax on or before the due date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Each insurance company and association transacting business in the District whose District premium tax liability for the preceding calendar year was $1,000 or more shall remit on or before June 1, on a prepayment basis, an amount equal to one-half of the premium tax liability for the preceding calendar year.  The sums prepaid by a company or association under this subsection shall be allowed as credits against its premium tax liability for the calendar year during which the payments are made.  If a prepayment made under this subsection exceeds the annual premium tax liability, the excess shall be allowed as a credit against subsequent prepayment or tax liabilities.  The Commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of a company or association that fails to make a prepayment on or before the due date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> A hospital service corporation or medical service corporation may deduct, up to $550,000, the corporation’s payment to the rate stabilization fund under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-3514.html">31-3514</a> and payments and expenditures pursuant to a public-private partnership entered into in accordance with Chapter 35 of this title from the amount otherwise due by the corporation under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Commissioner shall determine whether or not the tax remitted is correct. If the tax remitted is not sufficient, the Commissioner shall notify the delinquent company of the amount of such delinquency and certify the amount thereof to the Department of Finance and Revenue which shall proceed to collect such delinquency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> An insurer may offset an assessment made pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-5406.html">31-5406</a> (“Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act”), against its premium tax liability pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-5410.html">31-5410</a> to the extent of 10% of the amount of the assessment for each of the 10 calendar years following the year in which the assessment was paid.  If an insurer ceases doing business, all uncredited assessments may be credited against its premium tax liability for the year it ceases doing business.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> When by the laws of any other jurisdiction a premium or income or other taxes, or fees, fines, penalties, licenses, deposit requirement, or other obligations, prohibitions or restrictions are imposed upon District domestic insurance companies doing business in the other jurisdiction, or upon the agents of District companies, which in the aggregate are in excess of the aggregate of the taxes, fees, fines, penalties, licenses, deposit requirements or other obligations, prohibitions or restrictions directly imposed upon insurance companies of the other jurisdiction under the statutes of the District, the same obligations, prohibitions or restrictions for whatever kind are in the same manner and for the same purpose imposed upon insurance companies of the other jurisdiction doing business in the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Insurance premium taxes paid which were not paid under protest shall not be refunded if the refund claim is based upon an alleged error or mistake of law or erroneous interpretation of statute regarding the validity or legality of this section under the laws or constitution of the United States.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> For the purpose of this section, an alien insurer is deemed domiciled in a United States jurisdiction designated by it wherein it has established its principal office or agency in the United States, maintains the largest amount of its assets held in trust or on deposit for the security of its policyholders or policyholders and creditors in the United States, or in which it was admitted to do business in the United States.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> This section does not apply to ad valorem taxes on real or personal property or to personal income taxes.</p>
