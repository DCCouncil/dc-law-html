The Commission is hereby authorized, within the appropriation made by Congress, to incur and pay incidental expenses for postage, printing, blanks, books, law books, books of reference, and periodicals, stationery, binding, rebinding, repairing and preservation of records, desks, office furniture and supplies, traveling expenses of the Commission, the commissioners, and every officer, agent, and employee thereof, and all other general expenses reasonably necessary to be incurred in carrying out the purposes of this subtitle. All payments and disbursements, as provided in this subtitle, shall be made by the Disbursing Officer of the District of Columbia upon proper vouchers, certified as required by the Commission; and the Commission is hereby also granted power and authority to designate and appoint during its pleasure such officers, clerks, inspectors, and employees of the District of Columbia and members of the Metropolitan Police force of the District of Columbia to perform any of the duties which the Commission may from time to time, respectively, assign to them, and to employ any assistance within the limits of the appropriations for its use made by act of Congress.</p>

This 10-point preference shall be in addition to, and not instead of, qualifications established for the position. All persons hired after February 6, 2008, shall submit proof of residency upon employment in a manner determined by the Commission. An applicant claiming the hiring preference under this section shall agree in writing to maintain bona fide District residency for a period of 7 consecutive years from the effective date of hire and shall provide proof of such residency annually to the director of personnel for the Commission for the first 7 years of employment. Failure to maintain District residency for the consecutive 7-year period shall result in forfeiture of employment.</p>
