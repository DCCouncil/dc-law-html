                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The Mayor of the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the “Mayor”) shall be the central planning agency for the government of the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the “District”) in the National Capital. The Mayor shall be responsible for coordinating the planning activities of the District government and for preparing and implementing the District elements of the comprehensive plan for the National Capital, which may include land use elements, urban renewal and redevelopment elements, a multi-year program of public works for the District, and physical, social, economic, transportation, and population elements. The Mayor’s planning responsibility shall not extend to federal or international projects and developments in the District, as determined by the Commission, or to the United States Capitol Buildings and Grounds as defined in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-503.11.html">10-503.11</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-503.26.html">10-503.26</a>, or to any extension thereof or additions thereto, or to buildings and grounds under the care of the Architect of the Capitol. In carrying out his responsibility under this section, the Mayor shall establish procedures for citizen participation in the planning process, and for appropriate meaningful consultation with any state or local government or planning agency in the National Capital region affected by any aspect of a comprehensive plan (including amendments thereto) affecting or relating to the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The Mayor shall submit each District element of the comprehensive plan, and any amendment thereto, to the Council for revision or modification, and adoption, by act, following public hearings. Following adoption and prior to implementation, the Council shall submit each such element or amendment to the Commission for review and comment with regard to the impact of such element or amendment on the interests or functions of the federal establishment in the National Capital.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(A)">(A)</span> The Commission shall, within 60 days after receipt of such a District element of the comprehensive plan, or amendment thereto, from the Council, certify to the Council whether such element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal establishment in the National Capital. If within such 60 days the Commission takes no action with respect to such element or amendment, such element or amendment shall be deemed to have no such negative impact, and such element or amendment shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and shall be implemented.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(B)">(B)</span> If the Commission finds, within such 60 days, such negative impact, it shall certify its findings and recommendations with respect to such negative impact to the Council. Upon receipt of the Commission’s findings and recommendations, the Council may: (i) Reject such findings and recommendations and resubmit such element or amendment, in a modified form, to the Commission for reconsideration; or (ii) accept such findings and recommendations and modify such element or amendment accordingly. If the Council accepts such findings and recommendations and modifies such element or amendment under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the Council shall submit such element or amendment to the Commission for it to determine whether such modification has been made in accordance with the Commission’s findings and recommendations. If, within 30 days after receipt of the modified element or amendment, the Commission takes no action with respect to such element or amendment, it shall be deemed to have been modified in accordance with such findings or recommendations, and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and shall be implemented. If within such 30 days, the Commission again determines such element or amendment to have a negative impact on the functions or interests of the federal establishment in the National Capital such element or amendment shall not be implemented.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(C)">(C)</span> If the Council rejects the findings and recommendations of the Commission and resubmits a modified element or amendment to it under clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Commission shall, within 60 days after receipt of such modified element or amendment from the Council, determine whether such modified element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal establishment within the National Capital. If the Commission finds such negative impact it shall certify its findings (in sufficient detail that the Council can understand the basis of the objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council, and such element or amendment shall not be implemented. If the Commission takes no action with respect to such modified element or amendment within such 60 days, such modified element or amendment shall be deemed to have no such negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and it shall be implemented. Any element or amendment which the Commission has determined to have a negative impact on the federal establishment in the National Capital, and which is submitted again in a modified form not less than 1 year from the day it was last rejected by the Commission shall be deemed to be a new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure specified in this section.</p>

The office of the Commissioner of Public Buildings was abolished by § 103(b) of that Act.

All functions of all other officers of the Department of the Interior and all functions of all agencies and employees of such Department were, with 2 exceptions, transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, with power vested in him to authorize their performance or the performance of any of his functions by any of such officers, agencies, and employees, by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 3, §§ 1 and 2, 15 F.R. 3174, 64 Stat. 1262.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
