                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The National Capital Planning Commission (hereinafter referred to as the “Commission”) is created as the central federal planning agency for the federal government in the National Capital, and to preserve the important historical and natural features thereof, except with respect to the United States Capitol Buildings and Grounds as defined in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-503.11.html">10-503.11</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-503.26.html">10-503.26</a>, and to any extension thereof or additions thereto, or to buildings and grounds under the care of the Architect of the Capitol.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Mayor of the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the “Mayor”) shall be the central planning agency for the government of the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the “District”) in the National Capital. The Mayor shall be responsible for coordinating the planning activities of the District government and for preparing and implementing the District elements of the comprehensive plan for the National Capital, which may include land use elements, urban renewal and redevelopment elements, a multi-year program of public works for the District, and physical, social, economic, transportation, and population elements. The Mayor’s planning responsibility shall not extend to federal or international projects and developments in the District, as determined by the Commission, or to the United States Capitol Buildings and Grounds as defined in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-503.11.html">10-503.11</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-503.26.html">10-503.26</a>, or to any extension thereof or additions thereto, or to buildings and grounds under the care of the Architect of the Capitol. In carrying out his responsibility under this section, the Mayor shall establish procedures for citizen participation in the planning process, and for appropriate meaningful consultation with any state or local government or planning agency in the National Capital region affected by any aspect of a comprehensive plan (including amendments thereto) affecting or relating to the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The Mayor shall submit each District element of the comprehensive plan, and any amendment thereto, to the Council for revision or modification, and adoption, by act, following public hearings. Following adoption and prior to implementation, the Council shall submit each such element or amendment to the Commission for review and comment with regard to the impact of such element or amendment on the interests or functions of the federal establishment in the National Capital.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The Commission shall, within 60 days after receipt of such a District element of the comprehensive plan, or amendment thereto, from the Council, certify to the Council whether such element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal establishment in the National Capital. If within such 60 days the Commission takes no action with respect to such element or amendment, such element or amendment shall be deemed to have no such negative impact, and such element or amendment shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and shall be implemented.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> If the Commission finds, within such 60 days, such negative impact, it shall certify its findings and recommendations with respect to such negative impact to the Council. Upon receipt of the Commission’s findings and recommendations, the Council may: (i) Reject such findings and recommendations and resubmit such element or amendment, in a modified form, to the Commission for reconsideration; or (ii) accept such findings and recommendations and modify such element or amendment accordingly. If the Council accepts such findings and recommendations and modifies such element or amendment under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the Council shall submit such element or amendment to the Commission for it to determine whether such modification has been made in accordance with the Commission’s findings and recommendations. If, within 30 days after receipt of the modified element or amendment, the Commission takes no action with respect to such element or amendment, it shall be deemed to have been modified in accordance with such findings or recommendations, and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and shall be implemented. If within such 30 days, the Commission again determines such element or amendment to have a negative impact on the functions or interests of the federal establishment in the National Capital such element or amendment shall not be implemented.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> If the Council rejects the findings and recommendations of the Commission and resubmits a modified element or amendment to it under clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Commission shall, within 60 days after receipt of such modified element or amendment from the Council, determine whether such modified element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal establishment within the National Capital. If the Commission finds such negative impact it shall certify its findings (in sufficient detail that the Council can understand the basis of the objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council, and such element or amendment shall not be implemented. If the Commission takes no action with respect to such modified element or amendment within such 60 days, such modified element or amendment shall be deemed to have no such negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and it shall be implemented. Any element or amendment which the Commission has determined to have a negative impact on the federal establishment in the National Capital, and which is submitted again in a modified form not less than 1 year from the day it was last rejected by the Commission shall be deemed to be a new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure specified in this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> The Commission and the Mayor shall jointly publish, from time to time as appropriate, a comprehensive plan for the National Capital, consisting of the elements of the comprehensive plan for the federal activities in the National Capital developed by the Commission, and the District elements developed by the Mayor and the Council in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The Council may grant, upon request made to it by the Commission, an extension of any time limitation contained in this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> The Commission and the Mayor shall jointly establish procedures for appropriate meaningful continuing consultation throughout the planning process for the National Capital.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The National Capital Planning Commission shall be composed of: (1) Ex officio, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Mayor, the Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia and the Chairmen of the Committees on the District of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives, or such alternates as each such person may from time to time designate to serve in his stead, and in addition; (2) five citizens with experience in city or regional planning, 3 of whom shall be appointed by the President and 2 of whom shall be appointed by the Mayor. The citizen members appointed by the Mayor shall be bona fide residents of the District of Columbia and of the 3 appointed by the President at least 1 shall be a bona fide resident of Virginia and at least 1 shall be a bona fide resident of Maryland. The terms of office of members appointed by the President shall be for 6 years, except that of the members first appointed, the President shall designate 1 to serve 2 years and 1 to serve 4 years. Members appointed by the Mayor shall serve for 4 years. The members first appointed under this section shall assume their office on January 2, 1975. Any person appointed to fill a vacancy shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the member whom he shall succeed. The citizen members shall each receive compensation at the rate of $100 for each day such member is engaged in the actual performance of duties vested in the Commission in addition to reimbursement for necessary expenses incurred by them in the performance of such duties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The President shall designate the Chairman of the Commission and the Commission may elect from among its members such other officers as it deems desirable. The Commission is authorized to employ a Director, an Executive Officer, and such other technical and administrative personnel as it may deem necessary. Further, without regard to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-225.05.html">2-225.05</a> [repealed], the civil service and classification laws, or § 3109 of Title 5, United States Code, the Commission may employ, by contract or otherwise, the temporary or intermittent (not in excess of 1 year) services of city planners, architects, engineers, appraisers, and other experts or organizations thereof, as may be necessary to carry out its functions,  and in any such case the rate of compensation shall be fixed by the Commission so as not to exceed the rate usual for similar services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Commission may establish, with the consent of each agency concerned as to its representation, such advisory and coordinating committees composed of representatives of such agencies of the federal and District of Columbia governments as may be necessary or helpful to obtain the maximum amount of cooperation and correlation of effort among the various agencies of such governments, in order that the National Capital may be developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan. As it may deem appropriate, the Commission may invite representatives of the planning and developmental agencies of the environs to participate in the work of such committees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> As hereinafter more specifically described in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/2-1003.html">2-1003</a> to 2-1006, it shall be among the principal duties of the Commission to:</p>
