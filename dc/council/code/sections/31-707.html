If the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the Mayor, the insurer shall provide the Mayor a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information. Whenever it appears to the Mayor that the detailed explanation is without merit, the Mayor may require, after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of $100 for each day’s delay, or may suspend or revoke the insurer’s license.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Mayor may retain, at the registered insurer’s expense, those attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the Mayor’s staff reasonably necessary to assist in the conduct of the examination under subsection (a) of this section. Any person so retained shall be under the direction and control of the Mayor and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Each registered insurer producing records, books and papers for examination pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be liable for and shall pay the expense of the examination in accordance with Chapter 14 of this title governing cost of examinations.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If the insurer fails to comply with an order issued pursuant to this section, the Mayor shall have the power to examine the records, books, or other information in the possession of the insurer’s affiliates to obtain the relevant information. The Mayor shall also have the power to issue subpoenas, to administer oaths, and to examine under oath any person for purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the Mayor may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court. Every person shall be obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the District. A person shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which fees, mileage, and actual expense, if any, necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witness shall be itemized and charged against, and be paid by, the company being examined.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
