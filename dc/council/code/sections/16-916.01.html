The judicial officer shall not impute income to a parent who is physically or mentally unable to work or who is receiving means-tested public assistance benefits. The judicial officer shall issue written factual findings stating the reasons for imputing income at the specified amount.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Determine each parent’s adjusted gross income according to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Using the parents’ combined adjusted gross income, locate the basic child support obligation from the Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations referenced in subsection (w) of this section. If the parents’ combined adjusted gross income falls between the amounts shown in the schedule, the basic child support obligation shall be rounded up to the next higher amount.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Calculate each parent’s percentage share of combined adjusted gross income by dividing each parent’s adjusted gross income by the combined adjusted gross income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(D)">(D)</span> Multiply the basic child support obligation from subparagraph (B) of this paragraph by each parent’s percentage share of combined adjusted gross income from subparagraph (C) of this paragraph to determine each parent’s share of the basic child support obligation. When the parents do not have shared physical custody as defined in subsection (q) of this section, the parent with whom the child does not primarily reside shall be the parent with a legal duty to pay support. The parent with a legal duty to pay support shall pay that parent’s share of the basic child support obligation to the parent with whom the child primarily resides. Adjustments for health insurance premiums, extraordinary medical expenses, child care expenses, and SSDI derivative benefits shall be made to this amount according to subsections (i) through (l) of this section. The parent with whom the child primarily resides shall be presumed to spend that parent’s own share of child support directly on the child.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f-1)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Been served with notice of the hearing but has failed to appear; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f-1)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Failed to provide information about his or her gross income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f-1)(2)">(2)</span> If the judicial officer enters an order under this subsection, the judicial officer shall issue written factual findings stating the reasons for entering the order in the amount specified.</p>

The self-support reserve shall be calculated at 133% of the United States Department of Health and Human Services poverty guideline per year for a single individual. The self-support reserve shall be updated by the Mayor every 2 years with the updated amount to be published in the District of Columbia Register and made effective as of April 1.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(B)">(B)</span> As of April 1, 2007, the self-support reserve shall be $12,382.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(C)">(C)</span> As of April 1, 2009, the self-support reserve shall be $14,404. The Child Support Services Division of the Office of the Attorney General shall act promptly to ensure that all child support orders entered into on or after April 1, 2009 are modified, as appropriate and as permitted under applicable law, to incorporate the April 1, 2009 adjustment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(D)">(D)</span> As of April 1, 2015, the self-support reserve shall be $15,654.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> A parent with a legal duty to pay support, but with adjusted gross income below the self-support reserve, shall be considered unable to contribute the amount determined under subsection (f) of this section. The judicial officer shall treat a parent at this level of income on an individual basis, and shall determine the amount that the parent is able to pay, while meeting personal subsistence needs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(A)">(A)</span> Where the judicial officer finds that a parent with adjusted gross income below the self-support reserve has the ability to pay child support under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, there shall be a presumption that the parent can pay a minimum amount of $75 per month, while meeting personal subsistence needs. The presumption may be rebutted downward to $0 or upward above $75 per month by evidence of resources or circumstances affecting the parent’s ability to pay, including age, employability, disability, homelessness, incarceration, inpatient substance abuse treatment, other inpatient treatment, housing expenses, provision or receipt of in-kind resources or services, benefits received from means-tested public assistance programs, other public benefits, subsidies, tax credits, or other appropriate circumstances. </p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(B)">(B)</span> In any contested matter, the judicial officer shall ask the parent with a legal duty to pay support and the parent to whom support is owed, if present, if either has evidence that would rebut the presumption under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.  If either parent answers in the affirmative, that parent shall have an opportunity to present such evidence before an order is issued.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)(C)">(C)</span> The judicial officer shall issue written factual findings stating the reasons for the entry of an order below or above the $75 per month presumptive amount.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g-1)(2)">(2)</span> If the judicial officer determines that the parent to whom support is owed can meet his or her subsistence needs, the judicial officer shall order the parent with a legal duty to pay support to pay what he or she would otherwise be required to pay pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g-1)(3)">(3)</span> If the judicial officer determines that the parent to whom support is owed cannot meet his or her subsistence needs and the parent with a legal duty to pay support has an adjusted gross income below the self-support reserve under subsection (g) of this section, the judicial officer shall determine whether, for the support and maintenance of the child, the parent with a legal duty to pay support should pay more than he or she would otherwise be required to pay pursuant to subsection (g)(3) of this section.</p>

The modified self-support reserve shall be updated by the Mayor every 2 years with the updated amount to be published in the District of Columbia Register and made effective as of April 1.  As of April 1, 2015, the modified self-support reserve shall be $11,770.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The guideline shall not apply presumptively in cases where the parents’ combined adjusted gross income exceeds $240,000 per year. In these cases, the child support obligation shall not be less than the amount that the parent with a legal duty to pay support would have been ordered to pay if the guideline had been applied to combined adjusted gross income of $240,000. The judicial officer may exercise discretion to order more child support, after determining the reasonable needs of the child based on actual family experience. The judicial officer shall issue written factual findings stating the reasons for an award of additional child support.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(3)">(3)</span> A parent shall present proof of the increase in a health insurance premium incurred as a result of the addition of the child to the health insurance policy. The proof provided shall identify clearly that the source of the increase of the health insurance premium is the child subject to the support order. The cost to add the child shall be reasonable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(4)">(4)</span> If a parent has family health insurance coverage in the parent’s health insurance plan for a second family, the addition of the child who is subject to the support order need not result in an additional cost of health insurance coverage to the parent. The parent shall provide proof that the child has been added to the health insurance coverage. An adjustment shall not be made if there is no additional cost of health insurance coverage to the parent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(5)">(5)</span> Health insurance coverage shall be considered reasonable in cost if the cost to the obligated parent of providing coverage for the children subject to the support order pursuant to § 16-916.01(i)(3) does not exceed 5% of the parent’s gross income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> Extraordinary medical expenses are uninsured or unreimbursed medical expenses in excess of $250 per year, per child subject to the support order. These expenses include co-payments, deductibles, and contributions associated with public and private health insurance coverage, and costs that are reasonably necessary for orthodontia, dental treatment, asthma treatments, physical therapy, vision care, or the diagnosis or treatment of a health condition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> Extraordinary medical expenses shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their respective adjusted gross incomes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(3)">(3)</span> If extraordinary medical expenses are recurring and the judicial officer can reasonably determine future expenses when the support order is established or modified, the judicial officer shall add each parent’s proportionate share of the expenses to the parent’s share of the basic child support obligation. The parents shall pay other extraordinary medical expenses in proportion to their adjusted gross incomes when these expenses are incurred. If either parent advances payment for these expenses to a provider of services, the other parent shall reimburse that parent for the other parent’s proportionate share of the expense within 30 days of receiving written proof of the expense and payment.</p>

Child care expenses shall be determined by actual family experience, unless the judicial officer determines that the actual family experience is not in the best interest of the child. If there is no actual family experience, or if the actual family experience is not in the best interest of the child, the judicial officer shall determine a reasonable child care expense based on the cost of child care from a licensed source. If the primary residential parent chooses child care with an actual cost that is less than the level required to provide child care from a licensed source, the judicial officer shall use the actual child care expense to calculate the child support obligation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> If a child subject to the support order receives SSDI derivative benefits from the parent with a legal duty to pay support, the following adjustment to the child support obligation shall be made:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(1)">(1)</span> After the child support obligation is calculated pursuant to subsections (f) through (k) of this section, the amount of the SSDI derivative benefit paid to the child shall be subtracted from the child support obligation. If the SSDI derivative benefit is less than the child support obligation, the order shall be set at the difference between the child support obligation and the SSDI derivative benefit. If the SSDI derivative benefit is greater than the child support obligation, the order shall be set at zero.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(l)(2)">(2)</span> If the judicial officer finds that SSDI derivative benefits were paid to a child subject to the support order prior to the filing of the petition to establish or motion to modify child support, these benefits shall be credited toward any retroactive child support or accumulated arrears owed pursuant to the support order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> As the last calculation in the determination of child support, the judicial officer shall calculate a low-income adjustment to ensure that the parent with a legal duty to pay support is able to satisfy personal subsistence needs after the payment of child support. The judicial officer shall apply this low-income adjustment after additions to and deductions from the parent’s share of the basic child support obligation have been made pursuant to subsections (i) through (l) of this section. The low-income adjustment shall be calculated as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(1)">(1)</span> Calculate a child support obligation for the parent with a legal duty to pay support according to subsections (f) and (i) through (l) of this section.</p>

If the remainder is negative or less than $900 per year., apply subsection (g) of this section to determine the parent’s child support obligation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(3)">(3)</span> If the parent’s maximum ability to pay child support calculated under paragraph (2) of this subsection is greater than or equal to $900 per year., compare the parent’s maximum ability to pay child support to the child support obligation calculated in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The parent’s child support obligation shall be the lesser of these 2 amounts.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(4)">(4)</span><span class="level-num" id="(m)(4)(A)">(A)</span> If under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the parent with a legal duty to pay support would pay less than the child support obligation calculated pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the judicial officer may consider whether:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(4)(A)(i)">(i)</span> The parent to whom support is owed would be able to meet his or her subsistence needs; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(4)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> Whether the children would face extreme hardship if this amount were ordered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(4)(B)">(B)</span> The judicial officer, after considering the factors set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, may deviate from the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection; provided, that any deviation upward shall not exceed the basic child support obligation calculated pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(n)">(n)</span> The child support obligation, including additions for health insurance premiums, extraordinary medical expenses, and child care expenses, shall not exceed 35% of the adjusted gross income of the parent with a legal duty to pay support.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(o)">(o)</span><span class="level-num" id="(o)(1)">(1)</span> If the parties present a consent order, an agreement that is to become an order, or a written agreement that is to be merged in an order, the judicial officer shall examine the child support provisions of the agreement, and compare the child support provisions to the guideline. If the amount of child support agreed upon is different from the amount of child support that would be ordered presumptively upon application of the guideline, the judicial officer shall determine if the agreed-upon level of child support is fair and just. If the parties are represented by counsel, the judicial officer shall inquire whether the attorneys informed the clients of the guideline. If the clients have not been informed of the guideline, the judicial officer shall advise the attorneys to do so. If a party is not represented by an attorney, the judicial officer shall ensure that the party is aware of the child support amount that the court would order presumptively pursuant to the guideline.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(o)(2)">(2)</span> The propriety of a departure from the guideline based on the consent of the parties shall be justified in writing with a statement of the factors that form the basis for the judicial officer’s finding that the departure is fair and just. A transcript filed in the jacket shall suffice as a writing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(p)">(p)</span> Application of the guideline shall be presumptive. The guideline shall be applied unless its application would be unjust or inappropriate in the circumstances of the particular case. The propriety of any departure from the guideline under this subsection shall be justified in writing with a statement of the factors that form the basis for the judicial officer’s finding that the guideline amount is unjust or inappropriate. A transcript filed in the jacket shall suffice as a writing. The factors that may be considered to overcome the presumption are:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(1)">(1)</span> The needs of the child are exceptional and require more than average expenditures;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(5)">(5)</span> The parent with a legal duty to pay support needs a temporary period of reduced child support payments to permit the repayment of a debt or rearrangement of the parent’s financial obligations; a temporary reduction may be included in a support order if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(5)(A)">(A)</span> The debt or obligation is for a necessary expenditure of reasonable cost in light of the parent’s family responsibilities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(5)(B)">(B)</span> The time of the reduction does not exceed 12 months; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(5)(C)">(C)</span> The support order includes the amount that is to be paid at the end of the reduction period and the date that the higher payments are to commence;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(6)">(6)</span> The parent to whom support is owed receives child support for a child living in this parent’s home, other than the child subject to the support order, and the resulting gross income of the household to which support is owed causes the standard of living of that household to be greater than that of the household of the parent with a legal duty to pay support. For the purposes of this paragraph, the standard of living of a household shall be measured by dividing the gross income available to the household from all sources by the federal poverty guideline, as reported by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, for the number of adults contributing to the household, plus the number of children;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(p)(7)">(7)</span> A child subject to the support order has regular and substantial income that can be used for the care of the child without impairment of the child’s current or future education;</p>

The child support obligation shall be calculated according to the following procedure:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Determine the adjusted basic child support obligation by calculating the basic child support obligation pursuant to subsection (f)(2) of this section and multiplying it by 1.5.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Determine each parent’s proportionate share of the adjusted basic child support obligation based on each parent’s share of combined adjusted gross income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Determine the amount of child support to be retained by each parent by multiplying each parent’s share of the adjusted basic child support obligation by the percentage of time the child spends with the relevant parent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(1)(D)">(D)</span> Subtract the amount of child support to be retained by each parent from the relevant parent’s share of the adjusted basic child support obligation to determine the amount of each parent’s child support obligation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(1)(E)">(E)</span> The parent owing the greater amount under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph shall be the parent with a legal duty to pay support, and shall pay the difference between the 2 amounts to the other parent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(1)(F)">(F)</span> Additions to and deductions from the parents’ respective shares of the adjusted basic child support obligation determined under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, shall be made as specified in subsections (i) through (l) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(1)(G)">(G)</span> A child support obligation calculated based on shared physical custody shall not exceed the amount that the parent with a legal duty to pay support would pay if this parent’s child support obligation were calculated based on the other parent’s sole custody pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(2)">(2)</span> Where the presumption of shared physical custody does not apply because the child does not spend 35% or more of the time during the year with each parent, the judicial officer shall presumptively calculate the child support obligation based on sole physical custody pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(3)">(3)</span> If the presumption of shared physical custody applies pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, either parent may rebut this presumption by proving that the method of calculating the child support obligation based on shared physical custody would be unjust or inappropriate because of the parents’ particular arrangements for the custody of the child. If a parent rebuts this presumption, the judicial officer shall calculate the child support obligation based on sole physical custody pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(4)">(4)</span> If the presumption of shared physical custody does not apply pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, either parent may rebut the presumption that the support obligation should be calculated based on sole physical custody pursuant to subsection (f) of this section by proving that use of that method would be unjust or inappropriate based on the parents’ particular arrangements for the custody of the child and that a calculation based on shared physical custody would yield a fair and just result. If a parent rebuts the presumption that the child support obligation should be calculated based on sole physical custody under this paragraph, the judicial officer shall calculate the child support obligation based on shared physical custody pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(q)(5)">(5)</span> Where a parent has challenged the applicability of either method for calculating the child support obligation under this subsection, the judicial officer shall issue written factual findings stating the reason for using either the shared custody or sole custody method of calculation.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(1)">(1)</span> The parents in a child support proceeding shall exchange relevant information on finances or dependents every 3 years and shall be encouraged to update a support order voluntarily using the updated information and the guideline. Relevant information is any information that is used to compute child support pursuant to the guideline.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(2)">(2)</span> Every 3 years, in cases being enforced under title IV, part D of the Social Security Act, approved January 4, 1975 (88 Stat. 2351; 42 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.), the IV-D agency shall notify both parents of the right to a review, and, if appropriate, a modification of the support order under the guideline. The IV-D agency shall conduct the review in all cases where there is an assignment of support rights pursuant to § 4-205.19, and at the request of either parent in all other cases. If the IV-D agency conducts a review, the IV-D agency shall inform both parents if a modification is warranted under the guideline, and shall petition for a modification of the support order when there is an assignment of support rights or if requested by a parent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(3)">(3)</span> If a support order does not provide for the payment of medical expenses for each child subject to the support order, at the request of a party or the IV-D agency, the court shall modify the support order to provide for the payment of such expenses in accordance with section 16-916.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(4)">(4)</span><span class="level-num" id="(r)(4)(A)">(A)</span> There shall be a presumption that there has been a substantial and material change of circumstances that warrants a modification of a support order if application of the guideline to the current circumstances of the parents results in an amount of child support that varies from the amount of the existing support order by 15% or more. The presumption is rebutted by:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(4)(A)(i)">(i)</span> Proof of special circumstances, such as a circumstance that would justify a departure from the guideline; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(4)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> Proof of substantial reliance on the original support order issued prior to the adoption of or revision to the guideline, and that application of the guideline would yield a patently unjust result.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(4)(B)">(B)</span> If a change to the guideline results in a support order that differs from the current support order by 15% or more, the presumption stated in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall apply, and the current order may be modified without any additional showing of a change in circumstances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(4)(C)">(C)</span> Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the ability of a parent to seek a modification of a support order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in the needs of the child or the ability of the parent with a legal duty to pay support to pay, regardless of whether this change results in a support order that differs by 15% or more from the current order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(5)">(5)</span> In cases being enforced under title IV, part D of the Social Security Act, approved January 4, 1975 (88 Stat. 2371; 42 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.), upon receipt of notice and documentation establishing that a parent is incarcerated in a specific facility (except where the parent is incarcerated for contempt for failure to pay child support pursuant to section 46-225.02), the IV-D agency shall review the circumstances of both parents and determine if a modification of the support order is appropriate under the guideline. If the IV-D agency determines that a parent’s incarceration has resulted in a change in financial circumstances warranting a modification of the support order, the IV-D agency may request the court to suspend or modify the support order pursuant to this subsection. Upon receipt of such a request, the court shall modify the support order in accordance with the guideline. The court may modify the support order from the date on which the IV-D agency received notice under this paragraph of the parent’s incarceration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(6)">(6)</span> The basic child support obligation, as adjusted by additions and deletions made pursuant to subsections (i) through (l) of this section, shall be used to compute the amount of child support the guideline would yield for modification and to apply the test for the presumption.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(r)(7)">(7)</span> If a support order is issued after September 27, 1987, and the amount of the support order differs from the guideline, by order of the court or by a merged agreement of the parties, the presumption shall not apply within one year of the issuance of the support order.</p>
