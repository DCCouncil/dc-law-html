                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Compensation to be paid to a person for services rendered under this subsection shall not exceed $300, unless payment in excess of that limit is certified by the court, as necessary to provide fair compensation for services of an unusual character or duration, and the amount of the excess payment is approved by the presiding judge in the case.</p>
