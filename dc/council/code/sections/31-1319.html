The committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Commissioner and shall serve without compensation other than reimbursement for reasonable travel and per diem living expenses. No other committee of any nature shall be appointed by the Commissioner or the court in liquidation proceedings conducted under this chapter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> To fix the reasonable compensation of employees and agents, legal counsel, actuaries, accountants, appraisers, and consultants with the approval of the court;</p>

In the event that the property of the insurer does not contain sufficient cash or liquid assets to defray the costs incurred, the Commissioner may advance the costs incurred out of any appropriation for the maintenance of the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking. Any amounts advanced for expenses of administration shall be repaid to the Commissioner for the use of the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking out of the first available monies of the insurer;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(11)">(11)</span> To acquire, hypothecate, encumber, lease, improve, sell, transfer, abandon, or otherwise dispose of or deal with, any property of the insurer at its market value or upon terms and conditions that are fair and reasonable. The liquidator shall also have power to execute, acknowledge, and deliver all deeds, assignments, releases, and other instruments necessary or proper to effectuate any sale of property or other transaction in connection with the liquidation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(12)">(12)</span> To borrow money on the security of the insurer’s assets or without security and to execute and deliver all documents necessary to that transaction for the purpose of facilitating the liquidation. Any funds borrowed may be repaid as an administrative expense and have priority over any other claims in Class 1 under the priority of distribution;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(13)">(13)</span> To enter into any contracts necessary to carry out the order to liquidate, and to affirm or disavow any contracts to which the insurer is a party;</p>

Guaranty associations and foreign guaranty associations shall have reasonable access to the records of the insurer necessary for them to carry out their statutory obligations;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(17)">(17)</span> To deposit in 1 or more banks in the District the sums required for meeting current administration expenses and dividend distributions;</p>

A waiver of any defense by the insurer after a petition in liquidation has been filed shall not bind the liquidator. Whenever a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association has an obligation to defend any suit, the liquidator shall give precedence to such an obligation and may defend only in the absence of a defense by the guaranty associations;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(21)">(21)</span> To exercise and enforce all the rights, remedies, and powers of any creditor, shareholder, policyholder, or member, including any power to avoid any transfer or lien that may be given by the general law and that is not included within §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1324.html">31-1324</a> through <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/31-1326.html">31-1326</a>;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(24)">(24)</span> To exercise all powers now held or hereafter conferred upon receivers by the laws of the District not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.</p>

No commissions, premium taxes, assessments, or other fees shall be due on the charge pertaining to the extended period to report claims.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The enumeration, in this section, of the powers and authority of the liquidator shall not be construed as a limitation upon him or her, nor shall it exclude in any manner his or her right to do other acts not specifically enumerated or otherwise provided for, necessary or appropriate for the accomplishment of or in aid of the purpose of liquidation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Notwithstanding the powers of the liquidator stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the liquidator shall have no obligation to defend claims or to continue to defend claims subsequent to the entry of a liquidation order.</p>
