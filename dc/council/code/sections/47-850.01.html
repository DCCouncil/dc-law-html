The Mayor may require the shareholder or member to submit any information which the Mayor considers necessary, including the taxpayer identification numbers of the shareholder or member, any other person with an ownership or membership interest, and any person in the household of the shareholder or member. The Mayor may also require the shareholder or member, any other person with an ownership or membership interest, and any person in the household of the shareholder or member to submit information after the homestead has been qualified to determine whether the cooperative housing association remains entitled to the deduction for the homestead for the dwelling unit.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor may require the officers or managers of the cooperative housing association to distribute the application forms to its shareholders or members and to collect the completed application forms from such shareholders or members for return to the Mayor.
