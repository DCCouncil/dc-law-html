                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a-1)(2)">(2)</span> The date the property became subject to the special assessment;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> If an income-producing property has not reached required occupancy on or before the 1st day of the contribution period, the amount of the special assessment imposed on that income-producing property for the contribution period shall be prorated on a daily basis, so that the special assessment shall be paid only for the portion of the contribution period which elapses after the income-producing property initially reached required occupancy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If a residential condominium has not reached substantial completion on or before the 1st day of the contribution period, the amount of the special assessment imposed on the residential condominium shall be prorated on a daily basis, so that the special assessment shall be paid only for that portion of the contribution period which elapses after the residential condominium initially reached substantial completion.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The Project Developer and any subsequent owner of real property within the Waterfront Park Special Assessment shall provide notice to any buyer of real property in the Waterfront Park Benefit District of the levy of the special assessment, the filing of any consent to the levy, and the effect of the filing of the consent as described in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> The owner of real property subject to a special assessment under this subchapter may contest the amount of the special assessment (but not the authority to levy the special assessment) imposed on the real property by filing a written notice of appeal with the Chief Financial Officer not later than 60 days after the due date of the payment of the special assessment. The Chief Financial Officer shall promptly review the appeal and, if necessary, meet with the owner of the real property, consider written and oral evidence regarding the amount of the special assessment, and decide the appeal. If the result of the appeal requires the special assessment to be adjusted in favor of the owner of the real property, a cash refund shall not be made (except in the last year of the contribution period), but an adjustment shall be made to the next special assessment to be collected from that real property. No interest on the adjustment shall be due to the owner of the real property. This procedure shall be exclusive and its exhaustion by an owner shall be a condition precedent to any other appeal or legal action by the owner.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an unpaid special assessment shall be subject to the same penalty and interest provisions as a delinquent real property tax under this chapter. A lien for an unpaid special assessment, including penalty and interest, shall attach to the real property in the same manner as, and with a priority immediately junior to, a lien for delinquent real property tax under Chapter 13A of this title. The unpaid special assessment shall be collected in the same manner, under the same conditions, and subject to the same penalty as unpaid real property taxes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> If an interest or use on real property is subject to the special assessment because it is subject to taxation under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1005.01.html">47-1005.01</a>, an unpaid special assessment on such an interest or use shall be subject to the same penalty and interest provisions as a delinquent tax imposed under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1005.01.html">47-1005.01</a> and the unpaid special assessment shall be collected in the same manner, under the same conditions, and subject to the same penalty as an unpaid tax imposed under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1005.01.html">47-1005.01</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> Each special assessment shall be made part of the public record.</p>
