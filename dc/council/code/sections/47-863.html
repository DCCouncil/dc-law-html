The tax shall be considered due on the date that the total amount of real property tax was due but unpaid and shall be collected in the manner prescribed under Chapter 44.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, if the eligible household was transferred and the grantee failed to timely record a deed under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1431.html">47-1431</a> (or other evidence of the transfer in the case of a cooperative housing association), the real property shall be liable for the amount of the delinquent real property tax which was not timely paid, together with interest and penalty as provided in this chapter for the late payment of real property tax.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> In all other cases, the real property shall be liable for the amount of the delinquent real property tax which was not paid timely, together with interest and penalty as provided in this chapter for the late payment of real property tax; provided, that the Chief Financial Officer may establish a payment plan to collect the delinquent taxes.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The eligibility of an eligible household for the deduction shall not be affected by the transfer of the eligible household into a revocable trust if the transfer is without consideration and the eligible household remains the residence of the applicant-grantor before and after the transfer.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> No other person in the household of the individual, shareholder, or member shall claim a deduction for an eligible household in the District.

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Mayor may contract with a collection agency inside or outside of the District to verify the contents of any application form or return for the purposes of determining the eligibility of any eligible household.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The collection agency may charge a collection fee not in excess of 25% of the total amount of the delinquent taxes, excluding penalties and interest, that is actually collected; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The collection agency may be remunerated by fee, percentage of taxes collected, or both.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this title, confidential information related to the owner of the real property may be provided to a collection agency for purposes of collecting a delinquent tax under this chapter. If the information is provided to a collection agency under this subsection, the collection agency shall not disclose the information to a third party, other than the owner (or his or her representative), unless the Mayor would be authorized by law to make the disclosure. A collection agency, or employee of a collection agency, violating the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than the amount set forth in [§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/22-3571.01.html">22-3571.01</a>], or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both.
