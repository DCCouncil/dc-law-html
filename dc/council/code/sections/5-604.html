Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever a policeman or fireman, or his attorney or personal representative, receives any payment as described in the preceding sentence and fails to pay to the District of Columbia the amount of its lien, the District of Columbia is authorized to take appropriate action to recover from such policeman or fireman or his attorney or personal representative the amount of its lien, including, but not limited to, the right to counterclaim, setoff, or attach moneys or other property otherwise due and payable from the District of Columbia to said policeman or fireman, his guardian, personal representative, estate, dependents or survivors.</p>
