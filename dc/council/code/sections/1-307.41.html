                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> No insurer may deny enrollment of a child under the health plan of the child’s parent on the grounds that:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The child was born out of wedlock;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The child is not claimed as a dependent on the parent’s federal income tax return; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The child does not reside with the parent or in the insurer’s service area.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Where a child has health coverage through an insurer of a noncustodial parent, the insurer shall:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Provide such information to the custodial parent as may be necessary to obtain benefits through such coverage, including the information required under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/46-251.05.html">46-251.05</a>(a).</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Permit the custodial parent (or the provider, with the custodial parent’s approval) to submit claims for covered services without the approval of the noncustodial parent; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Make payments on claims submitted in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection directly to the custodial parent, the provider, or the District of Columbia Medicaid agency.</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2A)</span> Enroll the child and the employed parent under family coverage upon application by the child’s other parent, or by the District of Columbia agency administering either the Medicaid program or the child support enforcement program pursuant to Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, approved January 4, 1975 (88 Stat. 2351; 42 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.), if the employed parent is not enrolled and the health insurance plan requires the employed parent’s enrollment for the child to be eligible; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Not disenroll (or eliminate coverage of) the child unless the insurer is provided satisfactory written evidence that:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The court or administrative order is no longer in effect; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The child is or will be enrolled in comparable health coverage through another insurer which will take effect not later than the effective date of disenrollment.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> As a condition of doing business in the District:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An insurer shall not impose requirements on a District of Columbia agency that has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for medical assistance under the District State Medicaid Plan and covered for health benefits from the insurer that are different from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other individual so covered.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> An insurer shall:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Accept the District’s right of recovery and the assignment to the District of any right of an individual or other entity to payment from the insurer for an item or service for which payment has been made under the District State Medicaid Plan;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Respond to any inquiry by the District, or its agent, regarding a claim for payment for a health care item or service that the District submits within 3 years after the date that the health-care item or service was provided;</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Not deny a claim submitted by the District because of the date of submission of the claim, the type or format of the claim form, or for failure to present proper documentation at the point-of-sale that is the basis of the claim; provided, that the District:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Submits the claim within the 3-year period beginning on the date of which the item or service was furnished; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Commences an action to enforce its right with respect to the claim within 6 years of submitting the claim; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Upon the request of the Mayor, in a manner prescribed by the Mayor, provide coverage, eligibility, and paid claims data to the District, or its agent, to determine the period that individuals who received, or were eligible for, health care assistance were, or could have been, covered by an insurer and the nature of the coverage that is being, or was, provided by the health insurer. The data to be provided shall include:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Each individual’s:</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Any other information prescribed by the Mayor.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> For the purposes of this section, the term “insurer” includes a self-insured plan, a group health plan, as defined in section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, approved April 7, 1986 (100 Stat. 231; 29 U.S.C. § 1167(1)), a service benefit plan, a managed care organization, a pharmacy benefit manager, or other party that is, by statute, contract, or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for all or part of a health-care item or service.</p>
