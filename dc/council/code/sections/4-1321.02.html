                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span> A person specified in subsection (b) of this section shall report to the Child and Family Services Agency any child who is age 5 through 13 years and who has 10 or more days of unexcused absences within a school year, as that term is defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-201.html">38-201</a>(4).</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Persons required to report such abuse or neglect shall include Child and Family Services Agency employees, agents, and contractors, and every physician, psychologist, medical examiner, dentist, chiropractor, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, person involved in the care and treatment of patients, law-enforcement officer, humane officer of any agency charged with the enforcement of animal cruelty laws, school official, teacher, athletic coach, Department of Parks and Recreation employee, public housing resident manager, social service worker, day care worker, human trafficking counselor as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/14-311.html">14-311</a>(2), domestic violence counselor as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/14-310.html">14-310</a>(a)(2), and mental health professional as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-1201.01.html">7-1201.01</a>(11). Such persons are not required to report when employed by a lawyer who is providing representation in a criminal, civil, including family law, or delinquency matter and the basis for the suspicion arises solely in the course of that representation. Whenever a person is required to report in his or her capacity as a member of the staff of a hospital, school, social agency or similar institution, he or she shall immediately notify the person in charge of the institution or his or her designated agent who shall then be required to make the report. The fact that such a notification has been made does not relieve the person who was originally required to report from his or her duty under subsection (a) of this section of having a report made promptly to the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia or the Child and Family Services Agency.</p>
