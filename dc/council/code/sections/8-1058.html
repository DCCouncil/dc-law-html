                <p>Zoning Commission regulations: Section 2(d) of D.C. (Act 12-296) required, on an emergency basis that all portions of a solid waste facility be set back at least 500 feet from any property line. However, regulations promulgated by the  Zoning Commission, 45 DC 1848, require a 300 foot separation from residential property and a 50 foot separation from a public park, retail, office, and institutional property.</p>
