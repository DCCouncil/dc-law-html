Interest shall accrue on the amount due as provided in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The lien shall attach to all property belonging to the named person at any time during the period of the lien, including any property acquired by the named person after the lien arises.</p>
