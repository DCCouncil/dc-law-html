                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/18-349.html">D.C. Law 18-349</a> substituted “DDOE” for “The Department of the Environment” or “the Department of the Environment ”.</p>

(c)(1)(C), substituted “Department of General Services” for “Office of Property Management”; in subsec. (c)(1)(G), substituted “building permit” for “building construction permit”; and added subsec.
