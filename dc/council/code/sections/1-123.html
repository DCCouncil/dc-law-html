The convention shall write a constitution within 90 days which shall be republican in form and shall not be repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the United States, and it shall otherwise prepare for the admission of a major portion of the territory now known as the District of Columbia as a state.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The proposed Constitution for the State of New Columbia, approved by Congress June 24, 1987, is amended to read as set forth in Volume 1 of the District of Columbia Code.</p>
