                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The court finds, after considering the factors set forth in subsection (c) of this section, that the defendant is not a danger to the safety of any person or the community and that the interests of justice warrant a sentence modification.</p>
