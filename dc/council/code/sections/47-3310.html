No refund (other than inheritance and estate taxes) shall be allowed after 2 years from the date the tax is paid unless the taxpayer files a claim before the expiration of that period. The amount of refund of taxes (other than inheritance and estate taxes) shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim or, if no claim is filed, then the 2 years immediately preceding the allowance of the refund. No refund of inheritance and estate taxes shall be allowed after 3 years from the date the tax is paid unless the taxpayer files a claim before the expiration of that period. The amount of refund of inheritance and estate taxes shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim or, if no claim is filed, then during the 3 years immediately preceding the allowance of the refund. Every claim for refund must be in writing under oath, must state the specific grounds on which it is founded, and must be filed with the Mayor. If the Mayor disallows all or any part of the refund claim, he shall notify the taxpayer by registered or certified mail. After receiving notice of disallowance, if the claim is acted upon within 6 months of filing, or after the expiration of 6 months from the date of filing if the claim is not acted upon, the taxpayer may appeal as provided in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-3303.html">47-3303</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-3304.html">47-3304</a> of this title. This subsection does not apply to real estate taxes, alcoholic beverage tax, motor-vehicle fuel tax or to the taxes imposed by Chapter 18 of this title, or by Chapters 20 and 22 of this title, refunds of which are otherwise provided for by law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In any proceeding under this title the Superior Court has jurisdiction to determine whether there has been any overpayment of tax and to order that any overpayment be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, if a timely refund claim has been filed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, if it is determined by the Mayor or by the Superior Court that there has been an overpayment of any tax, whether as a deficiency or otherwise, interest shall be allowed and paid on the overpayment at the rate of 6% per annum from the date the overpayment was paid until the date of refund except:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Interest shall be allowed and paid only from the date of filing a claim for refund or a petition to the Superior Court, as the case may be, on that part of any overpayment that was not assessed and then paid as a deficiency or as additional tax; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Interest shall be allowed and paid only up to 6 years from the date the vendor filed with the Mayor the bond or prepayment with surety approved by the Mayor on the part of any overpayment that was a bond or prepayment with surety approved by the Mayor, as required by § 26a(d) (1) of A Regulation Governing Vending Businesses in Public Space (Reg. 74-39; 24 DCMR 524.7), except no interest shall be allowed and paid for any months after December 31, 1993.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> For purposes of this section, any interest or penalties paid by the taxpayer in connection with an overpayment of tax shall be deemed to be a part of the overpayment of tax.</p>
