The Commission may issue rules and regulations governing the conduct of such vehicles, including the type of vehicles, number of inspections, licensing of drivers, advertising, safety of the driver and of the public, financial obligations, and any other provisions necessary; provided, that the rules and regulations are necessary for the safety of customers and drivers, consumer protection, or the collection of non-personal trip data information. Any rules and regulations shall protect personal privacy rights of customers and drivers and shall not result in the disclosure of confidential business information.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a-1)</span> The Commission shall not require a company that provides digital dispatch to sedan-class vehicles to produce to the Commission a list or inventory of vehicles or operators affiliated with the service.</p>
