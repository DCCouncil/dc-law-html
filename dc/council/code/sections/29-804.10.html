                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The company shall furnish to each member:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Without demand, any information concerning the company’s activities and affairs, financial condition, and other circumstances which the company knows and is material to the proper exercise of the member’s rights and duties under the operating agreement or this chapter, except to the extent the company can establish that it reasonably believes the member already knows the information; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> On demand, any other information concerning the company’s activities and affairs, financial condition, and other circumstances, except to the extent the demand or information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The duty to furnish information under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall also apply to each member to the extent the member knows any of the information described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

The company shall respond to a demand made pursuant to this subsection in the manner provided in subsection (b)(3) of this section.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> A limited liability company may charge a person that makes a demand under this section the reasonable costs of copying, limited to the costs of labor and material.</p>
