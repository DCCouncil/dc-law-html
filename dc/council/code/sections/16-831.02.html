                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The court shall dismiss the action within 30 days of receiving proof that a court of competent jurisdiction has found that the third party has committed an intrafamily offense against the child, the child’s parent, or any other member of the child’s family.</p>
