                <h4>Applicability</h4>
                <p>Applicability of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-182.html">D.C. Law 21-182</a>: <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-182.html#§18">§ 18 of D.C.

                <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                <p> A certification dated June 6, 2017, that the fiscal effect of the Death with Dignity Act of 2016, D.C. Law 21-182, has been included in an approved budget and financial plan was published in the D.C. Register on June 16, 2017 (64 DCR 5670). Therefore the creation of this section by that amendment has been implemented.</p>
