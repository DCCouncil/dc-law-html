The board of directors shall also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances, it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders on any basis.</p>

The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. The notice shall also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation of the survivor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange shall require the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan exists, and, if any class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or share exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the merger or share exchange by that voting group is present.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> Separate voting by voting groups shall be required:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(7)(C)">(C)</span> Each shareholder of the corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger or share exchange will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the effective date of the merger or share exchange; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(7)(D)">(D)</span> The issuance in the merger or share exchange of shares or other securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares does not require a vote under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/29-304.21.html">29-304.21</a>(f).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(8)">(8)</span> If as a result of a merger or share exchange one or more shareholders of a domestic business corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange shall require the execution, by each such shareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such owner liability.</p>
