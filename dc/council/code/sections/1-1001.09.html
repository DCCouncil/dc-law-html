                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Any candidate or group of candidates may, not less than 2 weeks prior to such election, petition the Board for credentials authorizing watchers at 1 or more polling places and at the place or places where the vote is to be counted for the next election during voting hours and until the count has been completed. The Board shall formulate rules and regulations not inconsistent with this subchapter to prescribe the form of watchers’ credentials, to govern the conduct of such watchers, and to limit the number of watchers so that the conduct of the election will not of the election will not be unreasonably obstructed. Such rules and regulations should provide fair opportunity for watchers for all candidates or groups of candidates to challenge prospective voters whom the watchers believe to be unqualified to vote, to question the accuracy in the vote count, and otherwise to observe the conduct of the election at the polling place and the counting of votes.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c-1)</span> The Board shall issue rules for granting access to the electoral process, including access to polling places, ballot-tabulation centers, and other similar locations, to election observers. The rules shall take into account the need to avoid disruption and crowding in polling places and ballot-tabulation centers and the need to ensure that all questions posed by observers should be answered as fully, accurately, and cooperatively as possible. Election observers shall be allowed uniform and nondiscriminatory access to all stages of the election process, including the certification of election technologies, early and absentee voting, and vote tabulation. The Board shall issue a public notice with respect to any denial of a request by any election observer for access to any polling place for purposes of observing an election. The notice shall be issued not later than 24 hours after the denial.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A registered voter may challenge another voter’s status as a qualified elector of the District of Columbia by stating in writing the name of the person challenged, the basis for the challenge, and the evidence provided to support the challenge. The challenger shall sign an affidavit, declaring under penalty of perjury, that the challenge is based upon substantial evidence which he or she believes in good faith shows that the person challenged is not a qualified elector of the District. After receiving a challenge or making a challenge on his or her own initiative, the precinct captain or other official in charge of the polling place shall give the challenged voter an opportunity to respond.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a voter shall not be challenged solely on the basis of characteristics or perceived characteristics not directly related to the challenged voter’s status as a registered qualified elector, including race, color, religion, sex, personal appearance, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, matriculation status, political affiliation, or physical disability. The Board may remove a precinct captain or void the credentials of an authorized watcher, or refer the matter for prosecution as a violation of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.12.html">1-1001.12</a>, if the Board determines that the precinct captain or the watcher has violated the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The precinct captain shall review the evidence presented and shall affirm the challenge if he or she finds that it is based on substantial evidence specific to the voter being challenged and probative of the challenged voter’s status as a qualified elector. The precinct captain shall deny the challenge if he or she finds that the challenge is not based on substantial evidence that is specific to the voter being challenged and probative of the challenged voter’s status as a qualified elector. The precinct captain shall record the decision and the rationale for the decision on a form provided by the Board.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If the precinct captain denies the challenge, he or she shall inform the challenger that the challenger may appeal the decision to the Board and shall give the challenger copies of the rules regarding challenges and appeals to the Board. Any appeal of the precinct captain’s decision to deny the challenge shall be made either before the challenged voter casts a regular ballot, or before either the challenger or the challenged voter leaves the polling place, whichever is earlier. If the challenger does not appeal the precinct captain’s decision to deny the challenge, the challenged voter shall cast a regular ballot.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> If the challenger appeals the precinct captain’s decision to deny the challenge, the precinct captain shall state the facts of the case to the Board’s hearing officer, who is authorized to rule on the appeal for the Board. A Board member, the Board’s Executive Director, or the Board’s chief voter registration official may serve as the Board’s hearing officer for the appeal. The precinct captain shall contact the hearing officer by telephone. The hearing officer shall ensure that the hearing is recorded, and shall take testimony under oath from the challenger, the person challenged, the precinct captain, and any witnesses to the challenge who wish to testify. Each person who testifies before the hearing officer shall state for the record their:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Name as recorded on the Board’s voter registration list;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Residence address, mailing address, and telephone number; and</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The hearing officer shall receive evidence and testimony pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection and then shall close the hearing. The hearing officer shall review all of the evidence presented pertaining to the challenge and make a decision regarding the appeal, based on his or her determination of whether the challenger has presented substantial evidence that is specific to the voter being challenged and probative of the challenged voter’s status as a qualified elector. The recording of the hearing shall be transcribed and shall serve as the official case record along with the written documentation of the precinct captain’s initial decision to deny the challenge.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The hearing officer shall notify the precinct captain of his or her decision on the appeal of the unsuccessful challenge, and the precinct captain shall notify each party of the hearing officer’s decision. If the hearing officer affirms the precinct captain’s decision to deny the challenge, the challenged voter shall cast a regular ballot. The precinct captain shall inform the challenger of his or her right to appeal the decision of the Board hearing officer to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. If the hearing officer overturns the precinct captain’s decision to deny the challenge, the challenged voter shall be allowed to vote only by casting a paper ballot marked “challenged” in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (8) of this subsection.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(8)</span> If the precinct captain affirms the challenge made at the polling place, or if the Board’s hearing officer overturns the decision of the precinct captain to deny a challenge, the precinct captain shall allow the person to vote only by casting a paper ballot marked “challenged” and shall provide the voter with written notification of his or her right of appeal pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Challenged ballots shall be segregated, and no challenged ballot shall be counted until the challenge has been removed pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. The precinct captain shall not allow the challenged voter to cast a “challenged” ballot unless the voter signs an affidavit swearing or affirming, under penalty of perjury, that he or she is a registered qualified elector in the District of Columbia who resides in the precinct in which the ballot is to be cast, and if applicable, the Advisory Neighborhood Commission single-member district in which the ballot is to be cast.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d-1)</span> Any individual who alleges that their name has been erroneously omitted from the list of registered voters, or alleges that their name, address or party affiliation is erroneously printed on the list of registered voters, shall be permitted to cast a ballot. Ballots so cast shall be placed in a sealed envelope. The outside of the envelope shall contain the signature of the voter and such information as the Board deems necessary to determine that the individual is qualified to have the vote counted. The official in charge of the polling place shall provide the voter with written notification of appeal rights as provided in subsection (e) of this section, should the Board determine that the voter is not qualified to vote in the election.</p>

Any ballot cast under this subsection shall be separated and held apart from other special ballots not affected by the order.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> A voter’s signing of a challenged or special ballot envelope shall be deemed as the filing of an appeal by the voter of the refusal by the Board’s chief voter registration official to permit the voter to vote on election day by regular ballot, and a waiver of personal notice from the Board of any denial or refusal to a later count of the challenged or special ballot. The Board shall review all available evidence pertaining to the eligibility of each voter casting a challenged or special ballot, and shall make a preliminary decision about whether to count or to reject each challenged or special ballot based on its review of the available evidence.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In sufficient time to comply with the requirements of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act, approved August 28, 1986 (100 Stat. 924; 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff et seq.), the Board shall maintain a toll-free telephone service during regular business hours for any person who has voted by a challenged or special ballot to learn the Board’s preliminary decision whether to count or reject his or her ballot and the reason for each decision.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the Board has made a preliminary determination that a challenged ballot shall not be counted, it shall afford the challenged voter an opportunity to contest that determination in a hearing before the Board. The hearings authorized pursuant to this paragraph shall take place not later than 2 days after that election. The Board shall inform the voter of the date scheduled for the hearing and the manner by which he or she may learn the Board's final decision to count or reject the voter's challenged ballot. The notice shall be in writing and shall be provided to the voter at the time of voting. At the hearing, the voter may appear and testify. The Board shall make a final determination within one day after the date of the hearing. The voter may appeal the decision of the Board to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia within one business day after the date of the Board's decision. The decision of the court shall be final and not appealable.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If the Board has determined that a special ballot shall not be counted, it shall afford the voter an opportunity to contest that determination in a hearing held before the Board not later than 2 days after any election held pursuant to this subchapter. The Board shall inform the voter in writing, at the time of voting, of the date scheduled for the hearing and the manner by which the voter may learn whether the Board has decided to count or reject his or her special ballot. The Board shall make a final determination within one day after the date of the hearing. The voter may appeal the decision of the Board to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia within one business day after the date of the Board's decision. The decision of the court shall be final and not appealable.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> If a qualified elector is unable to record his or her vote by marking the ballot or operating the voting machine an official of the polling place shall, on the request of the voter, enter the voting booth and comply with the voter’s directions with respect to recording his or her vote. Upon the request of any such voter, a second official of the polling place shall also enter the voting booth and witness the recordation of the voter’s directions. The official or officials shall in no way influence or attempt to influence the voter’s decisions, and shall tell no one how the voter voted. The official in charge of the voting place shall make a return of all such voters, giving their names and disabilities.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> No person shall vote more than once in any election nor shall any person vote in a primary or party election held by a political party other than that to which he or she has declared himself or herself to be a member.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> A name written on a ballot in any election shall not be counted as valid unless the individual whose name is written on the ballot has complied with the requirements of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.08.html">1-1001.08</a>(r).</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> In the event that the total number of candidates of one party nominated to an office or group of offices of that party pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.08.html">1-1001.08</a>(a) or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.17.html">1-1001.17</a>(i) does not exceed the number of such offices to be filled, the Board may, prior to election day and, notwithstanding the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.08.html">1-1001.08</a>(c) or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-1001.17.html">1-1001.17</a>(i), declare the candidates so nominated to be elected without opposition, in which case the fact of their election pursuant to this subsection shall appear for the information of the voters on any ballot prepared by the Board for their party for the election of other candidates in the same election.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Copies of the regulations of the Board with respect to voting shall be made available to prospective voters at each polling place.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> The Board shall receive the ballots cast and deposit them in a secure place where they shall be safely kept for 22 months. Inspection of such ballots shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Board. Whenever the ballots shall have remained in the custody of the Board for 22 months, and no election contest or other proceeding is pending in which the ballots may be needed as evidence, the Board may destroy such ballots.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j-1)</span> Upon the conclusion of voting at any precinct, the Board shall post a summary count of votes cast at the precinct.
