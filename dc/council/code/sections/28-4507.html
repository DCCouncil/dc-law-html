                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)(B)">(B)</span> In any action brought pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court may award the District the relief sought and the cost of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> In any action under subsection (b) of this section, in which there has been a determination that a defendant violated a provision of this chapter, damages may be proved and assessed in the aggregate by the computation of illegal overcharges, or by such other reasonable system of estimating aggregate damages as the court may permit, without the necessity of separately proving the individual claim of, or amount of damage to, individuals on whose behalf the suit was brought.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The court may award under this section, pursuant to a motion by the District of Columbia promptly made, simple interest on actual damages for the period beginning on the date of service of the pleading of the District of Columbia setting forth a claim under this chapter and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for such period is just under the circumstances. In determining whether an award of interest under this section for any period is just under the circumstances, the court shall consider only:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> whether the District of Columbia or the opposing party, or either party’s representative, made motions or asserted claims or defenses so lacking in merit as to show that such party or representative acted intentionally for delay, or otherwise acted in bad faith;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> whether, in the course of the action involved, the District of Columbia or the opposing party, or either party’s representative, violated any applicable rule, statute, or court order providing for sanctions for dilatory behavior or otherwise providing for expeditious proceedings; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> whether the District of Columbia or the opposing party, or either party’s representative, engaged in conduct primarily for the purpose of delaying the litigation or increasing the cost thereof.</p>
