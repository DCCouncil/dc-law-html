                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The pregnant or parenting teen has no living parent, legal guardian, or other appropriate adult relative;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> The Department determines, in accordance with regulations issued by the Mayor, that the circumstances justify a determination of good cause for the applicant or recipient and dependent child to receive assistance while living apart from the pregnant or parenting teen’s parent, guardian, or other adult relative (with standards set forth in the regulations including consideration of the best interests of the dependent child).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> For purposes of the investigation made pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section, investigations shall be carried out by licensed social workers. Other trained professionals, such as doctors, nurses, or physiologists, who are deemed necessary to make sound health and safety determinations by the Department, may also be utilized.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> When a pregnant or parenting teen and the applicant’s or recipient’s dependent child are required to live with the pregnant or parenting teen’s parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative, or in a setting described in subsection (e) of this section, then TANF may be paid in the form of a protective payment.</p>

The Department shall consider the needs and concerns of the pregnant or parenting teen and the pregnant or parenting teen’s child in providing or assisting in locating a living arrangement for the pregnant or parenting teen. The Department shall then determine the appropriate living arrangement for the pregnant or parenting teen and require that the pregnant or parenting teen and the dependent child live in such a living arrangement as a condition of continued receipt of TANF benefits. If the Department determines that the pregnant or parenting teen’s circumstances have changed and the current arrangement ceases to be appropriate, the pregnant or parenting teen may live in an alternative appropriate arrangement and continue to receive TANF benefits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> For the purposes of this subsection, the term “second chance home” means an entity that provides individuals described in subsection (b)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section with a supportive and supervised living arrangement in which they are required to learn parenting skills, including child development, family budgeting, health and nutrition, and other skills to promote their long-term economic independence and the well-being of their children.</p>
