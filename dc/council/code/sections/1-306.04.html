A variety of means to secure community input should be utilized, including advisory and technical committees, community workshops, review of draft texts, public forums and hearings, and other means of discussion and communication. The District government, through its executive and legislative branches, will strive to ensure that the Comprehensive Plan, in all its elements, is both responsive and responsible.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Community input into the implementation of the District elements of the Comprehensive Plan will be assured by the requirement of a periodic review. Not less frequently than once every 4 years, beginning March 31, 2000, the Mayor shall submit to the Council a report, accompanied by a proposed resolution, on the progress made by the government of the District of Columbia in implementing the District elements of the Comprehensive Plan. The Council shall schedule a public hearing on the progress report and, following each review period, submit to the Mayor the findings of the Council and a copy of the public testimony on the progress report.</p>
