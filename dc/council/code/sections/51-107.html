Determination of amount and duration of benefits.</h1> <section class="content"><section><section class="line-group primary-content"><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> On and after January 1, 1938, benefits shall become payable from the Benefit Account of the District Unemployment Fund. All benefits shall be paid through employment offices.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> An individual’s “weekly benefit amount” shall be an amount equal to one twenty-sixth (computed to the next higher multiple of $1) of his total wages for insured work paid during that quarter of his base period in which such total wages were highest, with such other following limitations. The Director shall determine annually a maximum weekly benefit amount by computing 66 2/3% of the average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work, and shall on or before January 1st of the calendar year in which it shall be effective announce by publication in at least 1 newspaper of general circulation in the District, the maximum weekly benefit amount so determined. Such computation shall be made by determining total wages reported as paid for insured work by employers in each 12-month period ending June 30th and dividing said total wages by a figure resulting from 52 times the average of mid-month employment reported by employers for the same period. For the period from March 30, 1962, to December 31, 1962, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be determined and announced by the Director in accordance with the foregoing formula on the basis of wages and employment in the 12-month period ending June 30, 1961. The maximum weekly benefit amount so determined and announced for a calendar year shall apply only to those claims filed in that year qualifying for maximum payment under the foregoing formula. All claims qualifying for payment at the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be paid at the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect when the benefit year to which the claim relates was first established, notwithstanding a change in said amount for a subsequent calendar year. If the maximum weekly benefit amount is not a multiple of $1, then said maximum weekly benefit amount shall be computed to the next multiple of $1.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Effective January 1, 1986, through December 31, 1987, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be $250.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Effective January 1, 1988, and for each calendar year thereafter, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be determined by the Director of the Department of Employment Services (“Director”) by computing 50% of the average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work, unless the Director certifies to the Council on or before September 30th of the preceding year that the financial condition of the District Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund would be worsened by adoption and implementation of a maximum weekly benefit amount determined by that method. Any such certification by the Director shall be accompanied by a recommended maximum weekly benefit amount which shall not be less than the maximum weekly benefit amount then in effect and which shall become the maximum weekly benefit amount for the next calendar year, unless the Council passes a resolution disapproving the Director’s recommendation within 45 days after its receipt.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> For benefit years commencing on or after January 5, 1997, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be $309.</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(iii)</span> For benefit years commencing on or after April 12, 2005, the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be $359.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> If the Council passes a resolution of disapproval the maximum weekly benefit amount then in effect shall continue in effect for the next calendar year.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Each year the Director shall, on or before January 1st of the calendar year in which it shall be effective, announce by publication in at least 1 newspaper of general circulation in the District, the maximum weekly benefit amount.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> The computation of the average weekly wage paid to employees in insured work shall be made by determining total wages reported as paid for insured work by employers in each 12-month period ending March 31st and dividing said total wages by a figure resulting from 52 times the average of mid-month employment reported by employers for the same period.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> The maximum weekly benefit amount, however determined, announced for a calendar year shall apply only to those claims filed in that year qualifying for the maximum weekly benefit amount. All claims qualifying for payment at the maximum weekly benefit amount shall be paid at the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect when the benefit year to which the claim relates was first established, notwithstanding a change in the maximum amount for any subsequent calendar year.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> If the maximum weekly benefit amount, however computed, is not a multiple of $1, then it shall be rounded down to the next lower multiple of $1.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> To qualify for benefits an individual must have:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Been paid wages for employment of not less than $1300 in 1 quarter in his base period;</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Been paid wages for employment of not less than $1950 in not less than 2 quarters in such period; and</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Received during such period wages the total amount of which is equal to at least one and one-half times the amount of his wages actually received in the quarter in such period in which his wages were the highest.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If a claimant satisfies the above except that he received wages over the amount necessary to become eligible for maximum benefits, in the quarter in which his wages were the highest, then the additional wages received in such quarter shall not be considered in determining eligibility. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection, any otherwise qualified individual, the total amount of whose wages during such period is less than the amount required to have been received during such period under such paragraph, may qualify for benefits, if the difference between the amounts so required to have been received and the total amount of his wages during such period does not exceed $70, but the amount of his weekly benefit, as computed under subsection (b) of this section, shall be reduced by $1 if such difference does not exceed $35, or by $2 if such difference is more than $35. Wages received by an individual in the period intervening between the end of his last base period and the beginning of his last benefit year shall not be available for benefit purposes in a subsequent benefit year unless he has, subsequent to the commencement of such last benefit year, performed services for which he received wages for employment as defined in this subchapter, in an amount equal to at least 10 times the weekly benefit amount for which he qualifies in such last benefit year. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by any amount received or applied for with respect to such week as a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided, or contributed to, by any base period employer; except that no reduction shall be made under this sentence for any amount received under title II of the Social Security Act. For benefit years beginning on or after July 1, 2004, benefits payable to an individual who applied for or is receiving a retirement pension or annuity under a public or private retirement plan or system provided or contributed to by any base period employer shall, under duly prescribed regulations, be reduced (but not below zero) by the prorated weekly amount of such retirement pension or annuity which is reasonably attributable to such week, provided that the claimant has not made contributions to the pension or annuity. An amount received with respect to a period other than a week shall be prorated by weeks. When an individual’s weekly benefit amount is reduced by a pension, the individual’s maximum weekly benefit amount shall be deducted from his total amount of benefits determined pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. Benefits payable to an individual with respect to a week shall be reduced by the amount of wages received in lieu of notice of dismissal, defined as dismissal payments that the employer is not legally required to make.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Any otherwise eligible individual shall be entitled during any benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to 26 times his weekly benefit amount or 50% of the wages for employment paid to such individual by employers during his base period whichever is the lesser; provided, that the maximum duration of benefits determined on any initial claim made prior to March 15, 1983, shall continue to be 34 weeks during the benefit year to which the initial claim relates. Such total amount of benefits, if not a multiple of $1, shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Any individual who is unemployed in any week as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-101.html">51-101</a>(5) and who meets the conditions of eligibility for benefits of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-109.html">51-109</a> and is not disqualified under the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-110.html">51-110</a> shall be paid with respect to such week an amount equal to the individual’s weekly benefit amount less any earnings payable to the individual with respect to such week deductible in accordance with the following formula: $20 will be added to the weekly benefit amount; from the resulting sum will be subtracted 80% of any earnings payable to the individual for such week. The resulting benefits, if not a multiple of $1, shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1. In no event shall the amount paid for any week exceed the individual’s established weekly benefit amount.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> In addition to the benefits payable under the foregoing subsections of this section, each eligible individual who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to such week $5 for each dependent relative, but not more than $20 shall be paid to an individual as dependent’s allowance with respect to any 1 week of unemployment nor shall any weekly benefit which includes a dependent’s allowance be paid in the amount of more than the established maximum benefit amount. An individual’s number of dependents shall be determined as of the day with respect to which he first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year, and shall be fixed for the duration of such benefit year. The dependent’s allowance is not to be taken into consideration in calculating the claimant’s total amount of benefits in subsection (d) of this section; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to claims for benefit years commencing on or after January 5, 1997.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f-1)</span> For claims for benefit years commencing after August 9, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, in addition to benefits payable under subsections (a) through (e) of this section, each eligible individual who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to that week $15 for each dependent relative, but no more than $50 or 1/2 of the individual’s weekly benefit amount, whichever is less, with respect to any 1 week of unemployment. The amount of the dependent’s allowance paid to an individual shall not be charged to the individual account of an employer. The number of dependents of an individual shall be determined as of the day with respect to which the individual first files a valid claim for benefits in any benefit year and shall remain fixed for the duration of the benefit year. The dependent’s allowance shall not be taken into consideration in the total amount of benefits calculated pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, this subsection provides a program of extended benefits on and after January 1, 1972.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> As used in this subsection, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> “Extended benefit period” means a period which:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Begins with the third week after a week in which a state “on” indicator occurs;

or</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The 13th consecutive week of such period; provided, that no extended benefit period may begin by reason of a state “on” indicator before the 14th week following the end of a prior extended benefit period which was in effect with respect to the District.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> For weeks commencing after September 25, 1982, there is a state “on” indicator for the District for a week if the rate of insured unemployment under this subchapter for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Equaled or exceeded 120% of the average of such rates for the corresponding 13-week period ending in each of the preceding 2 calendar years; and</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Equaled or exceeded 5%; provided, that with respect to benefits for weeks of unemployment beginning on September 26, 1982, the determination of whether there is a state “on” or “off ” indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if:</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(I)</span> This subparagraph did not contain sub-subparagraph (i) thereof; and</p><p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The figure “5” contained in sub-subparagraph (ii) thereof was “6”: except, that notwithstanding any such provision of this subsection any week for which there would otherwise be a state “on” indicator shall continue to be such a week and shall not be determined to be a week for which there is a state “off ” indicator.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> There is a state “off ” indicator for the District for a week if, for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding 12 weeks, either sub-subparagraph (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph was not satisfied.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> “Rate of insured unemployment”, for purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, means the percentage derived by dividing: (i) the average weekly number of individuals filing claims for regular benefits in the District for weeks of unemployment with respect to the most recent 13-consecutive-week period as determined on the basis of reports to the Secretary of Labor, by (ii) the average monthly employment covered under this subchapter for the first 4 of the most recent 6 completed calendar quarters ending before the end of such 13-week period.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> “Regular benefits” means benefits payable to an individual under this subchapter or under any state law (including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemen pursuant to Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) other than extended benefits.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(F)</span> “Extended benefits” means benefits (including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemen pursuant to Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) payable to an individual under the provisions of this subsection for weeks of unemployment in his eligibility period.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(G)</span> “Eligibility period” of an individual means the period consisting of the weeks in his benefit year which begin in an extended benefit period and, if his benefit year ends within the extended period, any weeks thereafter which begin in a period.</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(H)</span> “Exhaustee” means an individual who, with respect to any week of unemployment in his eligibility period:</p><p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> Has received, prior to such a week, all of the regular benefits that were available to him under this subchapter or any state law (including dependents’ allowances and benefits payable to federal civilian employees and ex-servicemen under Chapter 85 of Title 5, United States Code) in his current benefit year that includes such a week; provided, that for the purposes of this subparagraph, an individual shall be deemed to have received all of the regular benefits that were available to him although as a result of a pending appeal with respect to wages that were not considered in the original monetary determination in his benefits year, he may subsequently be determined to be entitled to added regular benefits;
