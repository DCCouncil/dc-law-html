                <p>Subsection (b) of this section was added by the Act of June 29, 1953 and originally contained the phrase “armed robbery in violation of section 810 of such Act ( D.C. Code 22-3202).” Section 810 of the Act of March 3, 1901 is found in the Code as § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/22-2801.html">22-2801</a> and concerns the crime of robbery.  Section 22-3202 § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/22-4502.html">22-4502</a>, 2001 Ed. concerns the commission of a crime while armed.</p>
