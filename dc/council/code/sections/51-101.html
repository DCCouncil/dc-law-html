The Director shall not deny shared work benefits for any week to an otherwise eligible individual by reason of the application of any provision of the employment security law that relates to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to apply for or accept work with an employer other than the participating employer.</p><p>“(j) An individual shall be eligible to receive shared work benefits with respect to any week in which the Director finds that:</p><p>“(1) The individual is employed as a member of an affected unit subject to a shared work plan that was approved before the week in question and is in effect for that week;</p><p>“(2) The individual is able to work and is available for additional hours of work or full-time work with the participating employer;</p><p>“(3) The individual’s normal weekly hours of work have been reduced by at least 20% but not more than 40%, with a corresponding reduction in wages; and</p><p>“(4) The individual’s normal weekly hours of work and wages have been reduced as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection for a waiting period of one week which occurs within the period the shared work plan is in effect, which period includes the week for which the individual is claiming shared work benefits.</p><p>“(k) The Director shall pay an individual who is eligible for shared work benefits under this section a weekly shared work benefit amount equal to the individual’s regular weekly benefit amount for a period of total unemployment multiplied by the nearest full percentage of reduction of the individual’s hours as set forth in the employer’s shared work plan. If the shared benefit amount is not a multiple of $1, the Director shall reduce the amount to the next lowest multiple of $1. All shared work benefits under this section shall be payable from the fund.</p><p>“(l) The Director shall not pay an individual shared work benefits for any week in which the individual performs paid work for the participating employer in excess of the reduced hours established under the shared work plan.</p><p>“(m) An individual who has received all of the shared work benefits and regular unemployment compensation benefits available in a benefit year is an exhaustee under section 8(g)(1)(H) of the District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Act, approved August 28, 1935 (49 Stat. 949; D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/51-107.html">51-107</a>(g)(1)(H)), and shall be entitled to receive extended benefits under such statutes if the individual is otherwise eligible under such statutes.</p><p>“(n) The Director may terminate a shared work plan for good cause if the Director determines that the shared work plan is not being executed according to the terms and intent of the shared work unemployment compensation program.</p><p>“(o) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, an individual shall not be eligible to receive shared work benefits for more than 50 calendar weeks during the 12-month period of the shared work plan; provided, that 2 weeks of additional benefits shall be payable to claimants who exhaust regular benefits and any benefits under any other federal or state extended benefits program. No week shall be counted as a week for which an individual is eligible for shared work benefits for the purposes of this section unless the week occurs within the 12-month period of the shared work plan.”</p><p>Section 5(b) of <cite doc="D.C.
