                <p>“(c) The Mayor may use the funds in the National Capital Energy Fund to make energy efficiency loans to property owners for the initial costs of the installation of energy efficiency improvements.

                <p>“(d) Prior to the 1st issuance of PACE bonds, each energy efficiency loan funded from grant proceeds shall bear interest at a rate equal to the interest rate on 10-year United States Treasury Notes on the date of the execution of the loan or other agreement evidencing an energy efficiency loan of the 1st series of energy efficiency loans to be issued, plus 250 basis points. Upon the 1st issuance of PACE bonds, the interest rate on the outstanding energy efficiency loans used to secure payment of that issue of PACE bonds shall convert automatically, and without action by either the District or the property owner, to the interest rate on the 1st series of PACE bonds, plus an amount determined by the Mayor to be sufficient to pay all administrative costs specified in section 102. Thereafter, until the interest rate is converted as described in the prior sentence, all energy efficiency loans shall bear interest at the rate of interest on the series of PACE bonds issued immediately preceding the date of execution of the energy efficiency loan, plus an amount determined by the Mayor to be sufficient to pay all administrative costs specified in section 102. In all cases, the principal, interest, and administrative costs shall be separately stated to permit the allocation thereof as provided in this act.</p>
                <p>“(e) If the 1st source of funds deposited in the National Capital Energy Fund is not a grant but an obligation which requires the District to repay principal and interest thereon, the energy efficiency loan, or other, agreement shall be structured to repay such funding source plus administrative costs. Special Assessment payments shall be deposited in the same manner specified in  section 8-1778.21.</p>
                <p>“(f) A Special Assessment payment received prior to the issue of bonds secured by the Special Assessment payments may be used to provide a debt service reserve fund for the bonds.”</p>
