The report of death shall be registered if it has been electronically completed and filed in accordance with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/titles/7/chapters/2A/">this chapter</a>. The Registrar may require a written filing or signed attestation. If the report of death cannot be submitted to the Registrar within 5 days after the date of death, the funeral director shall give the Registrar notice of the reason for the delay. The Registrar shall issue rules pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-231.29.html">§ 7-231.29</a> to implement this provision.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The Registrar shall establish a procedure pursuant to which an individual may pre-designate a gender identity or expression as an individual wishes it to be reported on his or her report of death. The pre-designation shall be filed with the Registrar. The Registrar shall check the gender designation of each report of death and amend the report if there is a pre-designated gender identity or expression that differs from the reported gender designation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> If a decedent did not pre-designate a gender identity or expression with the Registrar pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, any individual may challenge the gender identity or expression reported to the funeral director within 10 days after the report of death has been registered, by filing a petition in court seeking an order to determine the gender identity or expression to be recorded for the decedent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Within 48 hours after death, the physician in charge of a patient's care for the condition which resulted in death shall complete, sign, and return the medical certification portion of the certificate of death to the funeral director, except when inquiry is required by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In the absence or inability of the death certifier, or with his or her approval, the medical certification may be completed by the death certifier's associate physician, the chief medical officer of the institution in which the death occurred, or the physician who performed an autopsy upon the decedent, if the death is due to natural causes.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> A manner of death that is believed to be other than by natural causes is subject to investigation and shall be reported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ("Medical Examiner") pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-1406.html#(b)">§ 5-1406(b)</a>.

When a death occurs on a moving conveyance while in international waters or air space, or in a foreign country or its air space and the body is first removed from the conveyance in the District, the death shall be registered in the District, but the report shall show the actual place of death if it can be determined.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(p)">(p)</span> In all other cases, the place where death is pronounced shall be considered the place where death occurred. If the date of death is unknown, the death certifier shall determine the date by approximation. If the date cannot be determined by approximation, the date found shall be entered and identified as the date of death.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(q)">(q)</span> Each report of death shall contain sections concerning the pronouncement of death, disposition of the body, medical certification of the cause of death, and the Social Security number of the deceased.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(s)">(s)</span> When death occurs in an institution and the attending physician is not available to pronounce death, another physician at the institution or the attending registered nurse who views the body may pronounce death, attest to the pronouncement by an approved electronic process, and, with the permission of the individual responsible for the medical certification, release the body to the funeral director.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(t)">(t)</span> Within 5 days of receipt of autopsy results or other information that would change the information in the cause of death section of the report of death from that originally reported, the death certifier shall submit a supplemental report to the Registrar to amend the report of death.</p>
