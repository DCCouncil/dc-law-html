                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. Source. Former  Section 9-501(3).</p>
                <p>2. Waiver: In General.  Section 1-102(3) addresses which provisions of the UCC are mandatory and which may be varied by agreement. With exceptions relating to good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care, immediate parties, as between themselves, may vary its provisions by agreement. However, in the context of rights and duties after default, our legal system traditionally has looked with suspicion on agreements that limit the debtor’s rights and free the secured party of its duties. As stated in former  Section 9-501, Comment 4, “no mortgage clause has ever been allowed to clog the equity of redemption.” The context of default offers great opportunity for overreaching. The suspicious attitudes of the courts have been grounded in common sense. This section, like former  Section 9-501(3), codifies this long-standing and deeply rooted attitude. The specified rights of the debtor and duties of the secured party may not be waived or varied except as stated. Provisions that are not specified in this section are subject to the general rules in  Section 1-102(3).</p>
                <p>3. Nonwaivable Rights and Duties. This section revises former  Section 9-501(3) by restricting the ability to waive or modify additional specified rights and duties: (i) duties under  Section 9-207(b)(4)(C), which deals with the use and operation of consumer goods, (ii) the right to a response to a request for an accounting, concerning a list of collateral, or concerning a statement of account ( Section 9-210), (iii) the duty to collect collateral in a commercially reasonable manner ( Section 9-607), (iv) the implicit duty to refrain from a breach of the peace in taking possession of collateral under  Section 9-609, (v) the duty to apply noncash proceeds of collection or disposition in a commercially reasonable manner ( Sections 9-608 and  9-615), (vi) the right to a special method of calculating a surplus or deficiency in certain dispositions to a secured party, a person related to secured party, or a secondary obligor ( Section 9-615), (vii) the duty to give an explanation of the calculation of a surplus or deficiency ( Section 9-616), (viii) the right to limitations on the effectiveness of certain waivers ( Section 9-624), and (ix) the right to hold a secured party liable for failure to comply with this Article ( Sections 9-625 and  9-626). For clarity and consistency, this Article uses the term “waive or vary” instead of “renounc[e] or modify,” which appeared in former  Section 9-504(3).</p>
                <p>This section provides generally that the specified rights and duties “may not be waived or varied.” However, it does not restrict the ability of parties to agree to settle, compromise, or renounce claims for past conduct that may have constituted a violation or breach of those rights and duties, even if the settlement involves an express “waiver.”</p>
                <p>4. Waiver by Debtors and Obligors. The restrictions on waiver contained in this section apply to obligors as well as debtors. This resolves a question under former Article 9 as to whether secondary obligors, assuming that they were “debtors” for purposes of former Part 5, were permitted to waive, under the law of suretyship, rights and duties under that Part.</p>
                <p>5. Certain Post-Default Waivers.  Section 9-624 permits post-default waivers in limited circumstances. These waivers must be made in agreements that are authenticated. Under  Section 1-201, an “ ‘agreement’ means the bargain of the parties in fact.” In considering waivers under  Section 9-624 and analogous agreements in other contexts, courts should carefully scrutinize putative agreements that appear in records that also address many additional or unrelated matters.</p>
