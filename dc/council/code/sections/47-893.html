                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Real properties owned by the District of Columbia, except an independent instrumentality or authority of the District of Columbia, the United States, or the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority; provided, that if an interest in or use of the land of such real property is subject to taxation under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1005.01.html">47-1005.01</a> because of a ground lease and the improvement is privately owned, the interest in or use of the land and the improvement shall be subject to the special assessment imposed by this subchapter based on the land area of the interest and the actual gross building area of the improvement (if not subject to District zoning) or the gross building area of the improvement (if subject to District zoning); provided further, that if the real property becomes owned by an entity other than the District of Columbia, the United States, or the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the provisions of this paragraph shall not exempt the real property from the special assessment imposed by this subchapter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Real properties on which, on June 1, 2007, occupied residential were located; provided, that after June 1, 2007, if the real property is redeveloped for nonresidential uses, or if the real property becomes part of a development project that may include a condominium regime, that consists of 5 or more dwelling units, the provisions of this paragraph shall not exempt the real property or subdivisions thereof from the special assessment imposed by this subchapter;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Real properties on which, on June 1, 2007, an active house of worship with a tax-exempt status was located; provided, that after June 1, 2007, if the real property is later used for a purpose other than as a house of worship, the provisions of this paragraph shall not exempt the real property from the special assessment imposed by this subchapter; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Real properties that received a certificate of occupancy for a building of over 10,000 square feet between January 1, 2003, and June 1, 2007, or which had a utility plan related to a building permit approved by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority between January 1, 2006, and October 31, 2006.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The special assessment applicable to a real property shall be equal to the sum of:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The storm drainage assessment factor of 0.118 multiplied by the land area of the real property or interest therein; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The water and sewer assessment factor of 0.0346 multiplied by the gross building area of the real property.</p>

The notice shall state the amount of the proposed special assessment and the procedure for appeal set forth in subsection (e) of this section. The Chief Financial Officer shall not recalculate either factor because an additional real property has become subject to the special assessment after the first determination under this paragraph. No further notice shall be required for future tax years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> If a real property becomes subject to the special assessment imposed by this subchapter after [January 29, 2008], the Chief Financial Officer shall give notice of the special assessment to the owner, as shown on the real property tax records of the District, of such real property within 90 days after the Chief Financial Officer determines the real property has become subject to the special assessment. The notice shall state the amount of the proposed special assessment and the procedure for appeal set forth in subsection (e) of this section. The real property shall become liable for the special assessment as of the beginning of the next succeeding tax year from the date on which such real property became subject to the special assessment. No further notice shall be required for future tax years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The owner of a real property may elect at least once annually and upon the sale of a real property, under procedures established by the Chief Financial Officer, to pay in a lump sum payment equal to the present value, calculated as of the next succeeding June 30th at an annual discount rate of 4.5%, of the total amount of all future annual special assessments to which the Chief Financial Officer determines the real property is subject under this subchapter. If the owner makes such a lump sum payment within 30 days from the date of the special assessment bill from the Chief Financial Officer, the real property shall not be subject to future annual special assessments under this subchapter.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Beginning in tax year 2008, special assessments under this subchapter shall be levied annually and shall be due on June 30 of the tax year.
