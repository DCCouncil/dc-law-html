                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The methodology adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall enable DOEE to reliably track changes in food and beverage-related greenhouse gas emissions over time and demonstrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions associated with food and beverage purchases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> On or before January 1, 2023, DOEE shall establish:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> On or before February 1, 2025, and each February 1 thereafter, each covered contracting agency shall report to DOEE on the progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with food and beverages procured by covered agencies during the preceding fiscal year in a format to be determined by DOEE and consistent with the methodology adopted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
