This hearing shall be scheduled within 45 days after the date the application is filed.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Personal service of the notice may be made in the following manner:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> By delivering a copy of the notice to:</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A person of suitable age and discretion who resides at the alleged responsible relative’s dwelling house or usual place of abode; or</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> By mailing the notice to the alleged responsible relative by certified mail, return receipt requested, and also by separate first-class mail. A certified mail notice of the complaint shall be sufficient, although unclaimed or refused by the respondent, when the first-class mail notice is not returned. Service by certified mail that is unclaimed or refused and first-class mail alone shall not be a sufficient basis to permit the entry of a default order of paternity in a case where the respondent fails to file an answer or otherwise fails to respond appropriately. Delivery may be made by a competent adult with no interest in the proceedings.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The notice shall include the following:</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> A demand that the alleged responsible relative bring to the hearing documentation of the cost, comprehensiveness, and accessibility of any health insurance available to the responsible relative for the child;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> Notice that the alleged responsible relative may be represented by counsel at any stage of the proceedings;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> An explanation that a request for a continuance may result in the setting of interim support or the posting of collateral; and</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The Clerk of the Court shall issue notice to the opposing party:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Stating that a hearing to determine the matter of support has been scheduled;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Containing the information stated in subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Including a copy of the motion for modification;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The hearing shall be scheduled within 45 days after the date the application is filed; and</p>
