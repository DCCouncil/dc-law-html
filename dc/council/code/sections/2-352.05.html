                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> The privatization contract shall be awarded through a publicized, competitive procurement process pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/titles/2/chapters/3A/subchapters/IV/">subchapter IV of this chapter</a>.</p>
