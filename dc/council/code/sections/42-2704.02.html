In addition, the Agency may issue notes to renew notes and bonds to pay notes, including, the interest thereon. Whenever expedient, the Agency may refund bonds, including bonds previously issued by other than the Agency, by the issuance of new bonds, regardless of whether the bonds to be refunded have matured. The Agency is the successor to any and all District of Columbia Section 11(b) bond issuing authority. The Agency may also issue bonds for a combination of refund, renewal, and financing programs authorized by this chapter.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-heading"> Obligations of the Agency. —</span> Except as expressly provided otherwise by the Agency, bonds and notes of the Agency are obligations payable solely from revenues derived from the respective housing projects which such obligations are issued to finance, provided that bonds and notes of the Agency issued, in whole or in part, for the purpose of enabling the Agency to make State and Local Government Loans are obligations payable solely, to the extent issued for such purpose, from revenues derived from repayment of State and Local Government Loans made from proceeds of such bonds and notes.

No notice (except as provided in this section), proceeding, consent, or approval shall be required for the issuance or performance of any bond, note, or other obligation of the Agency or the execution of any instrument relating thereto or to the security therefor, except as provided in this chapter or in rules and regulations promulgated by the Agency.
