A caretaker of a child receiving GAC shall not be considered a GAC recipient, or a member of the GAC assistance unit, even if the caretaker receives the payment on the child’s behalf.</p>

The Mayor shall specify what constitutes a valid authorization, but shall not require as a condition of eligibility that any specific court action is required concerning the care of the child.</p>
