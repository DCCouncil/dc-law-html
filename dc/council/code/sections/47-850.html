                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> For purposes of levying the real property tax during a tax year, the Mayor shall deduct $67,500, increased annually, beginning October 1, 2012, by the cost-of-living adjustment (if the adjustment does not result in a multiple of $50, rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50), from the assessed value of real property which qualifies as a homestead. The deduction shall be apportioned equally between each installment during a tax year and shall not be carried forward or carried back.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> To qualify the homestead and receive the deduction, the individual shall complete and file with the Mayor an application in a form prescribed by the Mayor. The individual shall certify, under penalty of perjury, the information provided on the application form and the application form shall be filed in the manner prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor may require the individual to provide any information which the Mayor considers necessary, including all taxpayer identification numbers of the individual, any other owner, any person with legal or equitable title, and any person in the household of the individual. The Mayor may also require the individual, any other owner, any person with legal or equitable title, and any person in the household of the individual to supply information after the homestead has been granted to determine whether the real property remains a homestead and entitled to the deduction.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> If a properly completed and approved application is filed during the period October 1 through March 31 of the tax year, the real property shall receive the deduction for the entire tax year. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if a properly completed and approved application is filed during the period April 1 through September 30, the real property shall receive 1/2 of the deduction for the second installment only.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> An individual may only claim one lot as a homestead. If a homestead comprises more than one lot, the deduction may only be applied against the estimated market value of one lot and the other lots shall not receive the deduction. Only one person in a household shall be entitled to claim a homestead in the District.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The real property tax bill shall indicate whether the real property is receiving the deduction.</p>
