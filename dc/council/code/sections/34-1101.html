Upon application of a public utility for a certificate of present and future public convenience and necessity pursuant to this subsection, the Commission, upon a hearing and notice to the public, shall issue an order granting or denying the application, in whole or in part, stating the reasons for the action. The Commission may prescribe terms and conditions upon a grant of an application for a certificate of present and future public convenience and necessity as the Commission, in its discretion, decides are necessary to further the present and future public convenience and necessity. The Commission is authorized to promulgate any rules necessary to implement this subsection.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Every public utility that was regulated by the Commission and that furnished a service or facility within the District of Columbia as of June 27, 1989 is deemed to have been granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Commission is authorized to promulgate any rules necessary to implement this section.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
