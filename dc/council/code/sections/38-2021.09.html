                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> In the event any teacher to whom this part applies shall die subsequent to March 6, 1952, after completing at least 18 months of eligible service and is survived by a spouse or domestic partner, such surviving spouse or domestic partner shall be paid an annuity beginning the day after the teacher dies, equal to 55% of the amount of an annuity computed as provided in subsection (a) of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.05.html">38-2021.05</a> with respect to such teacher, except that in the computation of the annuity under such subsection the annuity of the teacher shall be at least the smaller of: (A) forty per centum of his average salary; or (B) the sum obtained under such subsection after increasing his eligible service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of death and the date he would have become 55 years of age. Such annuity and any right thereto shall terminate on the last day of the month before: (A) the surviving spouse or domestic partner dies; or (B) the surviving spouse or domestic partner remarries or enters a new domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age. In the case of a surviving spouse or domestic partner whose annuity under this paragraph is terminated because of remarriage or entry into a new domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age, annuity at the same rate shall be restored commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce, or the new domestic partnership is terminated in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/32-702.html">32-702</a>(d), or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-904.html">16-904</a>(e), if:</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> The surviving spouse or domestic partner elects to receive the annuity which was terminated instead of a survivor benefit to which the surviving spouse or domestic partner may be entitled, under this part or another retirement system for employees of the federal or District government, by reason of the remarriage or new domestic partnership; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(ii)</span> Any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is repaid to the Custodian of Retirement Funds (as defined in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-702.html">1-702</a>(6), for deposit in the District of Columbia Teachers’ Retirement Fund established by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-713.html">1-713</a>(a).</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> If any teacher to whom this part applies shall die after completing at least 18 months of eligible service or after having retired under the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.03.html">38-2021.03</a> or § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.04.html">38-2021.04</a> and is survived by a spouse or domestic partner, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of: (A) sixty per centum of the teacher’s average salary divided by the number of children; (B) $ 900; or (C) $ 2,700 divided by the number of children. If such teacher is not survived by a spouse or domestic partner, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of: (A) seventy-five per centum of the teacher’s average salary divided by the number of children; (B) $ 1,080; or (C) $ 3,240 divided by the number of children. The child’s annuity shall commence on the first day after the teacher dies. Such annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child: (i) becomes 18 years of age unless he is then a student as described or incapable of self-support; (ii) becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless he or she is then such a student; (iii) becomes 22 years of age if he or she is then such a student and capable of self-support; (iv) ceases to be such a student after becoming 18 years of age unless he or she is then incapable of self-support; or (v) dies or marries; whichever first occurs. Upon the death of the surviving spouse or domestic partner or termination of the annuity of the child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though such spouse, domestic partner, or child had not survived the teacher.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> In the event any teacher to whom this part applies shall die subsequent to March 6, 1952, after completing at least 18 months of eligible service, and is not survived by a spouse, domestic partner, or children, but is survived by dependent parents or a dependent father or a dependent mother, such surviving dependent parents or parent shall be paid an annuity, beginning the first day of the month following the death of the teacher, equal to 55% of the amount of an annuity computed as provided in subsection (a) of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/38-2021.05.html">38-2021.05</a> with respect to such teacher, except that, in the computation of the annuity under such subsection, the annuity of the teacher shall be at least the smaller of 40% of his average salary, or the sum obtained under such subsection after increasing his eligible service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of death and the date he would have become 60 years of age; provided, that such payments shall be made jointly to surviving dependent parents and payment of such annuity shall continue after the death of either dependent parent; provided further, that all such payments or any right thereto shall cease upon the death of both dependent parents.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> In the event that a teacher to whom this part applies shall die after January 1, 2007, while performing qualified military service, the survivor or survivors of the teacher shall be entitled to receive any additional benefits provided under this part (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the teacher resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b-1)</span> Effective as of January 1, 2007, benefits payable under this part shall not be paid until at least 30 days, or a shorter period as may be permitted by law, but no more than 180 days after a teacher’s receipt of required distribution notices and election forms pursuant to section 402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. The notices must include a description of the teacher’s right, if any, to defer receipt of a distribution, the consequences of failing to defer receipt of the distribution, the relative value of optional forms of benefit, and other information as may be required by applicable regulations and guidance.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> As used in this section:</p>

                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Such unmarried child regardless of age who is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18; or</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Such unmarried child between 18 and 22 years of age who is a student regularly pursuing a full-time course of study or training in residence in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, college, university, or comparable recognized educational institution. For the purpose of this paragraph and paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section, a child whose 22nd birthday occurs before July 1st or after August 31st of a calendar year, and while he is regularly pursuing such a course of study or training, is deemed to have become 22 years of age on the 1st day of July after that birthday. A child who is a student is deemed not to have ceased to be a student during an interim between school years if the interim is not more than 5 months and if he shows to the satisfaction of the District of Columbia Retirement Board that he has a bona fide intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training in the same or different school during the school semester (or other period into which the school year is divided) immediately after the interim.</p>
