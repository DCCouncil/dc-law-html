                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Receive any consideration for his own personal account from any party dealing with the Trust in connection with a transaction involving the assets of the Trust.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> A transfer of real or personal property by a party in interest shall be treated as a sale or exchange if the property is subject to a mortgage or similar lien which the Trust assumes or if it is subject to a mortgage or similar lien which a party in interest placed on the property within the 10-year period ending on the date of the transfer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The prohibitions provided in subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to any of the following transactions:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> The providing of any ancillary service by a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or any state (including the District) if the bank or other institution is a fiduciary of the Trust and if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)(A)">(A)</span> The bank or similar financial institution has adopted adequate internal safeguards which assure that the providing of the ancillary service is consistent with sound banking and financial practice, as determined by federal or state supervisory authority; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)(B)">(B)</span> The extent to which the ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by the bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Mayor after consultation with federal and state supervisory authority), and adherence to the guidelines would reasonably preclude the bank or similar financial institution from providing the ancillary service (i) in an excessive and unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of the retirement program. The ancillary services shall not be provided for more than reasonable compensation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(4)">(4)</span> The exercise of a privilege to convert securities, but only if the Trust receives no less than adequate consideration pursuant to the conversion; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(5)(C)">(C)</span> The transaction is expressly permitted by the Mayor, or by a fiduciary (other than the bank, trust company, insurance company, or any affiliate) who has authority to manage and control the assets of the Trust.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Nothing in subsection (c) of this section shall be construed to prohibit any fiduciary from:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> Receiving any benefit to which he may be entitled as a participant or beneficiary in the retirement program, so long as the benefit is computed and paid on a basis which is consistent with the terms of the retirement program as applied to all other participants and beneficiaries;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> Receiving any reasonable compensation for services rendered, or for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred, in the performance of his duties with respect to the Trust; or</p>

The Mayor shall only request exemptions that have been granted by the United States Secretary of Labor. Any proposed exemption submitted to the Council shall be accompanied by written findings by the Mayor that the proposed exemption is administratively feasible, in the best interests of the Trust and its participants and beneficiaries, and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the Trust.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span><span class="level-num" id="(i)(1)">(1)</span> Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to the Trust who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this section shall be personally liable to make good to the Trust any losses to the Trust resulting from each breach and to restore to the Trust any profits of the fiduciary which have been made through the use of assets of the Trust by the fiduciary and shall be subject to whatever other equitable or remedial relief the court may deem appropriate, including removal of the fiduciary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> No fiduciary shall be liable with respect to a breach of fiduciary duty under this section if the breach was committed before he became a fiduciary or after he ceased to be a fiduciary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(3)">(3)</span> No action may be commenced under this chapter with respect to a fiduciary’s breach of any responsibility, duty, or obligation under this section later than 3 years from the date the plaintiff knew or should have known of the alleged breach, except that in the case of fraud or concealment, the action may be commenced not later than 6 years after the date of the plaintiff ’s discovery of the alleged breach or violation.</p>
