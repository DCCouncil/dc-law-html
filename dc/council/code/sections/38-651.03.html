                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p>The 2016 amendment by <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-77.html">D.C. Law 21-77</a> would have added “or, if the student is 18 years of age or older, another adult suitable to serve as an emergency contact” in (a)(1)(B).</p>
                <h4>Applicability</h4>
                <p>Applicability of <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-77.html">D.C. Law 21-77</a>: <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/21-77.html#§4">§ 4 of D.C.
