If the tax or part of the tax shall remain unpaid after the expiration of 2 years from the date the tax was levied, the property against which the tax was levied may be sold for the tax or the unpaid portion of the tax, with interest and penalties, at the next ensuing annual tax sale conducted pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1301.html">47-1301</a> in the same manner and under the same conditions as property sold for delinquent general real estate taxes, if the tax with interest and penalties is not paid in full prior to the sale.</p>
