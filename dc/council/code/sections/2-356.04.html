                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> These boards shall include highly qualified professional employees of the District and may include private practitioners of architecture, engineering, or related professions.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> For each architectural and engineering services contract over $100,000, the CPO shall appoint an architect-engineer selection committee. The selection committee for architectural and engineering services contracts under this amount shall be established in accordance with rules promulgated by the CPO. The selection committee shall evaluate current statements of qualifications and performance data on file with the District and those that may be submitted by other firms regarding the proposed contract. The selection committee shall conduct discussions with no less than 3 firms regarding the contract and the relative utility of alternative methods of approach for furnishing the required services, and then shall select therefrom, in order of preference, based upon criteria established and published by the selection committee, no less than 3 of the firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required.</p>

A contracting officer shall proceed as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> If the contracting officer is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified, negotiations with that firm shall be terminated and the contracting officer shall then undertake negotiations with the 2nd most qualified firm.</p>
