In the case of a member who is an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, these deductions and withholdings shall be paid to the District of Columbia Retirement Board and shall be deposited in the District of Columbia Police Officers and Fire Fighters’ Retirement Fund established by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-712.html">1-712</a>, and in the case of any other member, these deductions and withholdings shall be paid to the Collector of Taxes of the District of Columbia and shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the District of Columbia.

The receipt of payment of such deductions by such member shall void all annuity rights under such sections, unless and until such member shall be reappointed to any department whose members come under such sections.

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If there be none of the above, to the parents of such former member, or the survivor of them; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> If there be none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the estate of the deceased former member, or if there be none to the person or persons determined to be entitled thereto under the laws of the domicile of the deceased former member: provided, that if no natural person is determined to be entitled thereto such payment shall escheat to the government of the District of Columbia, except that if the member was an officer or member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, no payment shall be made if no natural person is determined to be entitled thereto.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> An individual withdrawing a distribution under this subchapter, which distribution constitutes an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the District of Columbia Retirement Board, and after receipt of proper notice, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan, within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, in a direct rollover in accordance with section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be entrusted with any transfer from another retirement plan for the purchase of service credit, including transfers allowed by sections 403(b) and 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. § 403; 26 U.S.C. § 457]. Before any transfer is received, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be presented with documentation sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 governing the substantiation of proposed transfers for the purchase of service credit.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall also be entrusted with a rollover contribution from an eligible retirement plan, including:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A qualified plan described in sections 401(a) or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, excluding after-tax employee contributions;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, excluding after-tax employee contributions;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> An eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Amounts transferred from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in gross income.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The rollover shall be separately accounted for as member contributions that were not previously taxed. Before any rollover is received, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall be presented with documentation sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 governing the substantiation of proposed rollover contributions. The rollover shall be used to purchase service credit in addition to service credit provided under the provisions of § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-704.html">5-704</a>.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The provisions of this subchapter shall constitute a defined benefit plan and a governmental plan as described in section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which is intended to qualify under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subchapter, Chapter 7 of Title 1 (§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-701.html">1-701</a> et seq.), or Chapter 9 of Title 1 (§ <cite path="§1-901">1-901</cite> et seq.), the provisions of this subchapter shall apply to and control the provision of an annuity payable. The District of Columbia Retirement Board shall administer the plan in the manner required to satisfy the applicable qualification requirements for a qualified governmental plan pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If a conflict should arise with a qualification requirement, the provision shall be interpreted in favor of maintaining the federal qualification requirements.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> The District of Columbia Retirement Board may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(j)</span> Effective January 1, 2007, benefits payable under this subchapter shall not be paid until at least 30 days (or shorter period as may be permitted by law) but no more than 180 days after a member’s receipt of all required distribution notices and election forms pursuant to section 402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The required notices must include a description of the member’s right (if any) to defer receipt of a distribution, the consequences of failing to defer receipt of the distribution, the relative value of optional forms of benefit, and other information as may be required by applicable regulations and guidance.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(k)</span> Notwithstanding any provisions of this subchapter to the contrary, upon the employer’s request, a contribution which was made by a mistake of fact shall be returned to the employer by the trustee within one year after the payment of the contribution. A portion of a contribution returned pursuant to this section shall be adjusted to reflect any earnings or gains. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subchapter to the contrary, the right or claim of a participant or beneficiary to an asset of the trust or a benefit under this subchapter shall be subject to and limited by the provisions of this subsection.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(l)</span> For the purposes of this section, the term:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> “Direct rollover” means a payment to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee described in section 402(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> “Distributee” means a member or former member. In addition, the member’s or former member’s surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. A non-spouse beneficiary of a deceased member is also a distributee for the purposes of this subchapter; provided, that in the case of a non-spouse beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual retirement account or annuity under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is established on behalf of the non-spouse beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The determination of the extent to which a distribution to a non-spouse beneficiary is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be made in accordance with IRS Notice 2007-7, Q&amp;A 17 and 18, 2007-5 I.R.B. 395.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> “Eligible retirement plan” means:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> An individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> A qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(E)</span> An eligible plan described in section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution and agrees to account separately for amounts transferred into such plan from the arrangement described under this subsection. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> “Eligible rollover distribution,” within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, is a distribution of all or a portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee; provided, that an eligible rollover distribution does not include:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> A distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; and</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> A distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A distribution to a nonspouse beneficiary under section 401(f)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is an eligible rollover distribution. A portion of the distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, the portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or to a qualified trust or annuity plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the trust or annuity plan or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible.</p>
