                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The interstate commission shall elect or appoint annually from among its commissioners a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws.  The chairperson, or in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the interstate commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Officers selected in subsection (b) of this section shall serve without remuneration from the interstate commission.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The liability of the executive director and employees of the interstate commission or representatives of the interstate commission, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person's state, may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents.  The interstate commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.</p>
