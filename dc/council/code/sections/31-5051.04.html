                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, an insurer may terminate an enrolled customer’s enrollment under a portable electronics insurance policy upon 15 days notice for discovery of fraud or material misrepresentation in obtaining coverage or in the presentation of a claim under the policy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, an insurer may immediately terminate an enrolled customer’s enrollment under a portable electronics insurance policy:</p>

For purposes of this subsection, an enrolled customer’s provision of an electronic mail address to the insurer or vendor of portable electronics, as the case may be, shall be deemed consent to receive notices and correspondence by electronic means as long as disclosure to that effect is provided to the customer. The insurer or vendor of portable electronics, as the case may be, shall maintain proof that the notice or correspondence was sent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Notice or correspondence required by this section or otherwise required by law may be sent on behalf of an insurer or vendor, as the case may be, by the supervising entity appointed by the insurer.</p>
