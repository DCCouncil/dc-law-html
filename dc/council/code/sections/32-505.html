                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The employer demonstrates that denial of restoration of employment is necessary to prevent substantial economic injury to the employer’s operations and the injury is not directly related to the leave that the employee took pursuant to this chapter; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The employer notifies the employee of the intent to deny restoration of employment and the basis for the decision at the time the employer determines denial of restoration of employment is necessary.</p>
