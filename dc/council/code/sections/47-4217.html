The preparation of a substantial portion of a return or claim for refund shall be deemed to be the preparation of the entire return or claim for refund. The term “tax return preparer” shall not mean a person who only:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance;</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer (or an officer, partner, member, or employee of the employer) by whom the person is regularly and continuously employed; or</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Prepares, as a fiduciary, a return or claim for refund for a person.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> “Understatement of liability” means an understatement of the net amount due with respect to a tax imposed by this title or an overstatement of the net amount creditable or refundable with respect to the tax.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> A tax return preparer shall sign the return or claim for refund as a tax return preparer.
