                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> “Tax return preparer” means a person who prepares for compensation, or who employs one or more persons to prepare for compensation, a return of tax imposed by this title or a claim for refund of tax imposed by this title. The preparation of a substantial portion of a return or claim for refund shall be deemed to be the preparation of the entire return or claim for refund. The term “tax return preparer” shall not mean a person who only:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer (or an officer, partner, member, or employee of the employer) by whom the person is regularly and continuously employed; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Prepares, as a fiduciary, a return or claim for refund for a person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> “Understatement of liability” means an understatement of the net amount due with respect to a tax imposed by this title or an overstatement of the net amount creditable or refundable with respect to the tax.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> A tax return preparer shall sign the return or claim for refund as a tax return preparer. A tax return preparer who fails to sign a return or claim for refund shall pay a penalty of $50 for each unsigned return or claim for refund unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> A tax return preparer shall pay a penalty of $250 for each return or claim for refund prepared by the tax preparer which understates a taxpayer’s liability if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> A part of an understatement of liability with respect to a return or claim for refund was due to the tax treatment of an item for which there was not a realistic possibility of success on its merits;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The tax return preparer knew or reasonably should have known of the tax treatment of the item; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)(B)">(B)</span> The position was frivolous.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> A tax return preparer shall pay a penalty of $1,000 for each return or claim for refund prepared by the tax return preparer that understates a taxpayer’s liability if a part of an understatement of liability with respect to a return or claim for refund was due to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(A)">(A)</span> A willful attempt in any manner to understate the liability for tax with respect to the return or claim for refund; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(B)">(B)</span> A reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The amount of the penalty payable by a person by reason of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of the penalty paid by the person by reason of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a person is subject to a penalty of $1,000 if the person:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Aids or assists in, procures, or advises with respect to, the preparation or presentation of a portion of a return, affidavit, claim for refund, or other document (for purposes of this paragraph, the term “procures” includes ordering or otherwise causing a subordinate to perform an act and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation in the act by any other person (whether or not the person is a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer involved) over whose activities the person has direction, supervision, or control);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Knows or has reason to believe that the portion will be used in connection with a material matter arising under a tax imposed by this title; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Knows that the portion would result in an understatement of the liability for tax of another person.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> If the return, affidavit, claim for refund, or other document relates to the tax liability of a corporation, the amount of the penalty imposed by this subsection shall be $10,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> If a person is subject to a penalty under this subsection with respect to a document relating to a taxpayer for a taxable period (or where there is no taxable period, a taxable event), the person shall not be subject to a penalty under this subsection with respect to another document relating to the taxpayer for the taxable period (or event).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> This subsection shall apply whether or not the understatement is made with the knowledge or consent of the persons authorized or required to present the return, affidavit, claim for refund, or other document.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a person furnishing typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance with respect to a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted in the preparation of the document by reason of the assistance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(6)">(6)</span> The penalty imposed by this section shall be in addition to any penalty assessed under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(7)">(7)</span> A penalty on a person shall not be assessed under subsection (c) of this section with respect to a return for which a penalty is imposed on the person under this subsection.</p>
