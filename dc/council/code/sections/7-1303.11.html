                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> A person with an intellectual disability, or the father, mother, spouse, or adult child of a person with an intellectual disability, who receives habilitation, care, or both from the District pursuant to this chapter, shall pay to the District the costs of habilitation, care, or both received by the person with an intellectual disability if the person with an intellectual disability, or the father, mother, spouse, or adult child of the person with an intellectual disability, or the estate of the person with an intellectual disability is able to pay the costs of habilitation, care, or both received.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> If any person made liable by subsection (a) of this section does not pay the costs of habilitation, care, or both received by the person with an intellectual disability, the court shall issue to the liable person a citation to show cause why that person should not be adjudged to pay a portion or all of the expenses of habilitation, care, or both of the person with an intellectual disability. The citation shall be served at least 10 days before the show cause hearing. If, upon the hearing, it appears to the court that the person made liable by subsection (a) of this section does not have sufficient resources to pay the full costs of habilitation, care, or both received by the person with an intellectual disability, the court may order the payment of a reasonable amount of the costs of habilitation, care, or both received based on the liable person’s resources. The court may order the liable person to make payments quarterly, monthly, or at any other interval deemed appropriate by the court. The order may be enforced against any property of the liable person as if the order were an order for temporary alimony in a divorce case.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor may examine, under oath, the father, mother, spouse, adult child, and the executor of the estate of the person with an intellectual disability who receives habilitation, care, or both if the person lives in the District of Columbia, to ascertain the person’s ability, or the ability of the estate, to pay the full costs or contribute to the costs of habilitation, care, or both of the person with an intellectual disability.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, effective January 1, 2012, a person with an intellectual disability who is otherwise eligible to receive supports and services from the District pursuant to this chapter must either pay the full cost of such supports and services directly to the provider or become District Medicaid-eligible and maintain District Medicaid eligibility in order to receive supports and services under this chapter from a District Medicaid-eligible provider. This requirement shall not apply to a person:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Who is a former resident of Forest Haven;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Whose needs cannot reasonably be met by a District Medicaid provider;</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Who is eligible for enrollment in the D.C. Healthcare Alliance; or</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(D)</span> Whose representative payee for the purposes of Social Security benefits is the Department of Disability Services or a provider agency who is contracted with the District to provide supports and services for that person, if the reason the person lost Medicaid eligibility is due to a failure by the representative payee.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The Department of Disability Services shall work with and support the person to become District Medicaid-eligible and to maintain District Medicaid eligibility, and the person and his or her representatives, estate, or both shall fully cooperate in such efforts.</p>
