                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a-2)">(a-2)</span> In determining whether an applicant can demonstrate residency pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-751.01.html#(32)">§ 4-751.01(32)</a>, the Department shall search Department databases and other data systems to which it has access to assist individuals and families in demonstrating residency.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a-4)">(a-4)</span> If the Mayor determines that an individual or family has an ownership interest in safe housing or is listed on a lease or occupancy agreement for safe housing, the Mayor may presume that the individual or family is not eligible for shelter, unless the individual or family provides credible evidence that the individual or family cannot safely inhabit the housing associated with the lease or occupancy agreement. This presumption shall not apply to individuals or families seeking shelter for reasons of domestic violence, sexual assault, or human trafficking.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b-1)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Without limitation, upon receipt of new and relevant information regarding program eligibility related to the age, household composition, an absence of more than 4 consecutive days without good cause (according to a standard established by the Mayor), or identification as a tenant on a residential lease or occupancy agreement of an individual or family receiving services within the Continuum of Care, the Mayor may redetermine the individual or family's program eligibility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b-1)(2)">(2)</span> The Mayor may not determine that an individual or family is ineligible for services within the Continuum of Care pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection if the individual or family cannot safely inhabit the housing associated with the lease or occupancy agreement that identifies the individual or family as a tenant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b-1)(3)">(3)</span> An individual or family shall have the right to continue their current services while the Mayor redetermines their eligibility pursuant to this subsection.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Serving as a resource center for families who are seeking information about the availability of services within the Continuum of Care.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1A)">(1A)</span> The Mayor shall operate an intake center specializing in crisis intervention services and located in close proximity to the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1B)">(1B)</span> Intake workers shall provide the following for each individual seeking services:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1B)(A)">(A)</span> An overview of the shelter’s policies in regards to the protection of residents based upon actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c-1)(2)">(2)</span> The Mayor may extend an interim eligibility placement no more than 3 times; provided, that an interim eligibility placement shall not exceed a period of 12 days, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (6) of this subsection and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/4-754.11.html#(a)(20)">§ 4-754.11(a)(20)</a>; except, that the Mayor may extend an interim eligibility placement to coincide with the period of a public health emergency declared pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-2304.01.html">§ 7-2304.01</a>.</p>
