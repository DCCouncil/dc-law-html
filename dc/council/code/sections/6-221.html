Financial disclosure and conflict of interest — employees.</h1> <section class="content"><section><section class="line-group primary-content"><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> An affidavit of financial disclosure shall be completed and submitted by each employee of the Authority prior to the effective date of employment, and shall be updated annually, if required by the Authority. Refusal to comply with this requirement shall be cause for removal or termination. The form or forms of disclosure shall be developed by the Authority’s General Counsel or designated Ethics Officer and approved by the Board, and the completed disclosure forms shall be retained in the records of the General Counsel or Ethics Officer.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> For a period of one year after termination or expiration of his or her term of employment, no Officer shall appear before any court or government department or agency as agent or attorney for anyone other than the Authority in connection with any proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which the Authority is substantially interested, whether or not he or she took any action or made any decision as officer in connection with such matter. This provision shall not preclude compliance with a subpoena duly issued to any former Officer.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Any Officer or employee of the Authority who has a conflict of interest must disclose the nature and circumstances of the conflict to the Authority and the General Counsel.
