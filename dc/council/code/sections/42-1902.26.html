                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The provisions of this section and other applicable law; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Any lawful restrictions and limitations specified in the condominium instruments.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> An amendment to the declaration shall assign new identifying numbers to the new units created by the subdivision of a unit and shall allocate to those units, on a reasonable basis acceptable to the subdivider, all of the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to the subdivided unit. The new units shall jointly share all rights, and shall be equally liable jointly and severally for all obligations, with regard to any limited common elements assigned to the subdivided unit except to the extent that the subdivider may have specified in his written application that all or any portions of any limited common elements assigned to the subdivided unit exclusively should be assigned to 1 or more, but less than all of the new units, in which case the amendment to the declaration shall reflect the desires of the subdivider as expressed in such written application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> An amendment to the bylaws shall allocate to the new units, on a reasonable basis acceptable to the subdivider, the votes in the unit owners’ association allocated to the subdivided unit, and shall reflect a proportionate allocation to the new units of the liability for common expenses and rights to common profits formerly appertaining to the subdivided unit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Such plats and plans as may be necessary to show the boundaries separating the new units together with their other boundaries shall be prepared, and the new units depicted thereon shall bear their new identifying numbers. Such plats and plans shall indicate the dimensions of the new units, and the horizontal boundaries thereof, if any, shall be identified thereon with reference to established datum. Such plats and plans shall be certified as to their accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this subsection:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> By a registered land surveyor in the case of any plat; and</p>
