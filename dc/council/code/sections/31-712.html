                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> No distribution shall be recoverable if the parent or affiliate shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know, and could not reasonably have known, that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Any person that was a parent corporation, holding company, or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable, under subsection (a) of this section, up to the amount of distributions or payments such a person received.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any person that otherwise controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions the person would have received if they had been paid immediately.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If 2 or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The maximum amount recoverable under this section shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds.</p>
                      <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> To the extent that any person liable under subsection (c) of this section is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it, its parent corporation, holding company, or person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation, holding company, or person who otherwise controlled it.</p>
