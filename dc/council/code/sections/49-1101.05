Upon receipt of the unofficial educational records by a school in the receiving state, the school shall enroll and appropriately place the student based on the information provided in the unofficial records, pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student, the school in the receiving state shall request the student’s official educational record from the school in the sending state. Upon receipt of this request, the school in the sending state will process and furnish the official educational record to the school in the receiving state within 10 days or within such time as is reasonably established under the rules promulgated by the Interstate Commission.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Compacting states shall give students 30 days from the date of enrollment, or such time as is reasonably established under the rules promulgated by the Interstate Commission, to obtain any immunizations required by the receiving state.
