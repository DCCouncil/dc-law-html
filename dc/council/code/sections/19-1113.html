If an event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred, the substitute custodial trustee designated under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/19-1103.html">19-1103</a> becomes the custodial trustee, or, if a substitute custodial trustee has not been designated, the person who made the designation may designate a substitute custodial trustee pursuant to section 19-1103. In other cases, the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative may designate a substitute custodial trustee.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If a custodial trustee or successor custodial trustee is ineligible, resigns, dies, or becomes incapacitated, the successor designated under section 19-1102(g) or section 19-1103 becomes custodial trustee. If there is no effective provision for a successor, the beneficiary, if not incapacitated, may designate a successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary is incapacitated, or fails to act within 90 days after the ineligibility, resignation, death, or incapacity of the custodial trustee, the beneficiary’s conservator becomes successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary does not have a conservator or the conservator fails to act, the resigning custodial trustee may designate a successor custodial trustee.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> A custodial trustee who declines to serve or resigns, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodial trustee, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial trust property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodial trustee. The successor custodial trustee may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial trust property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.</p>
