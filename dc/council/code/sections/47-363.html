                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/laws/18-370.html">D.C. Law 18-370</a> rewrote the section, which formerly read:</p>
                <p>“(a) The Mayor shall submit to the Council for approval any reprogramming request(s) which individually or on a cumulative basis would result in a change to the original appropriated or estimated non-appropriated authority of any responsibility center, or, in a performance-based agency, of any program or activity of $500,000 or more or 10% (whichever is less) of the original appropriated or estimated non-appropriated authority in any fiscal year; provided, however, that Council approval shall not be required for any reprogramming of up to $25,000. Council approval is required for any subsequent reprogrammings which individually or considered on a cumulative basis would result in additional changes of more than $100,000 or 10% (whichever is less) of the original appropriated or estimated non-appropriated authority of any responsibility center.</p>
                <p>“(a-1)(1) The Mayor shall also submit reprogramming requests to the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority as required by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-392.03.html">47-392.03</a>(c)(1).</p>
                <p>“(2) The Council may only approve a reprogramming submitted by the Mayor to the Council pursuant to the provisions of this section and § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-392.03.html">47-392.03</a>(c)(2).</p>
                <p>“(3)(A) After the adoption of the annual budget for a fiscal year that is not a control year, no reprogramming of amounts in the budget may occur unless;</p>
                <p>“(i) The Mayor submits a request for such reprogramming to the Council and the Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia;</p>
                <p>“(ii) The Chief Financial Officer transmits to the Council a statement certifying the availability of funds for the reprogramming and containing an analysis of the effect of the reprogramming on the financial plan and budget for the fiscal year; and</p>
                <p>“(iii) The Council approves the request after receiving the statement described in sub-sub-paragraph (ii) of this paragraph, but only if any additional expenditures provided under the request are offset by reductions in expenditures for another activity.</p>
                <p>“(B) If the Chief Financial Officer does not transmit to the Council the statement described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph during the 15-day period which begins on the date the Chief Financial Officer receives the request for the reprogramming from the Mayor, the Chief Financial Officer shall be deemed to have transmitted the statement to the Council. Upon written notice to the Mayor and Council, the Chief Financial Officer may extend the time period to transmit the statement and analysis to the Council, not to exceed 10 additional days.</p>
                <p>“(C) In this paragraph, the term ‘control year’ has the meaning given such term in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-393.html">47-393</a>(4).</p>
                <p>“(b) The Mayor shall submit to the Council for approval any shift(s) in funding among object categories within the same responsibility center which individually exceed $50,000 in any fiscal year. Council approval is required for any subsequent actions which individually would move funds in excess of $50,000 among object categories within the same responsibility center in any fiscal year.</p>
                <p>“(c) The Mayor shall submit to the Council for approval a reprogramming request when an agency proposes to:</p>
                <p>“(1) Transfer funds of $500,000 or more in any fiscal year from one capital project or sub-project to another capital project or sub-project;</p>

                <p>“(3) Establish a new capital project or sub-project; or</p>
                <p>“(4) Change the capital project or sub-project description to alter the:</p>
                <p>“(A) Scope;</p>
                <p>“(B) Purpose; or</p>
                <p>“(C) Location.</p>
                <p>“(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the Mayor shall submit to the Council for approval any reprogramming request(s) which individually or considered on a cumulative basis would result in change to the original appropriated or estimated non-appropriated authority of any responsibility or control centers within the Department of Human Services, by more than $50,000 in any fiscal year. Additional Council approval shall be required for additional reprogrammings which individually or considered on a cumulative basis would result in additional changes of more than $50,000 to the original appropriated or estimated non-appropriated authority of any responsibility centers within the Department of Human Services.</p>
                <p>“(e)(1) The Mayor shall transmit reprogramming requests as provided in subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section to the Chairman of the Council, who shall immediately circulate the requests to the members of the Council.</p>
                <p>“(2) The Council shall consider the request(s) according to its rules. Should no written notice of disapproval of such request(s) be filed with the Secretary to the Council within 14 calendar days of the receipt of a request from the Mayor, or no oral notice of disapproval is given during a meeting of the Council during such 14 calendar day period, the request shall be deemed to be approved. Should notice of disapproval be given during such initial 14-calendar day period, the Council may approve or disapprove the reprogramming request by resolution within 30 calendar days of the initial receipt of the request from the Mayor, or such request shall be deemed to be approved.</p>
                <p>“(3) No request may be submitted to the Chairman of the Council under this subsection during such time as the Council is on recess, according to its rules, nor shall any time period provided in this subsection or in the Council’s rules with respect to the requests continue to run during such time as the Council is on recess.</p>
                <p>“(4)(A) Upon receipt of a reprogramming request submitted pursuant to this subchapter, the Chairman of the Council shall cause a ‘notice of a reprogramming request’ to be published in the District of Columbia Register, together with a statement that the request will be deemed approved 14 days from the date of its receipt unless a ‘notice of disapproval’ has been filed prior to that time by any member of the Council, and if such ‘notice of disapproval’ has been filed, that the request will be deemed approved 30 days from the date of the receipt of the reprogramming request unless prior to that time the Council has adopted a resolution of disapproval or approval.</p>
                <p>“(B) The publication of the ‘notice of a reprogramming request’ pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall satisfy the public notice requirements of this section and the rules of the Council and no further notice shall be necessary for the Council to adopt a resolution affecting the reprogramming request.</p>
                <p>“(5) At any time prior to final action by the Council on a reprogramming request submitted pursuant to this subchapter, or prior to a reprogramming becoming effective without Council action as provided in this subchapter, the Mayor may withdraw the reprogramming request.</p>
                <p>“(e-1) Reprogrammings transmitted to the Council pursuant to subsections (a), (b), (c), and (e) of this section shall include a specific listing of responsibility centers and control centers, or both, from which funds are being reduced and a specific listing of responsibility centers and control centers, or both, to which funds are being added. Each separate reprogramming request shall be for the total net sum of zero dollars.</p>
