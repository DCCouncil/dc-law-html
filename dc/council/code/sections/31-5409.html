                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Report to the Board of Directors when the Mayor has reasonable cause to believe, from any examination, whether completed or in process, of any member insurer, that the insurer may be an impaired or insolvent insurer; and</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> Furnish to the Board of Directors the ratios developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Insurance Regulatory Information System, and listings of companies not included in the ratios.

                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> In no event shall the examination report be released to the Board of Directors prior to its release to the public, except in compliance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(6)</span> The Mayor shall notify the Board of Directors when the examination is completed.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(7)</span> The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the Mayor, but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public.</p>
                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The Board of Directors may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the Mayor for the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies.</p>
