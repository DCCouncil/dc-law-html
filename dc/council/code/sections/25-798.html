                <p>“Sec. 2. Definitions.</p>

                <p>“(1) ‘Congestion’ means the significant increase in vehicular or foot traffic within the police service area where the venue is operated over a period of time not to exceed 8 hours that is associated with patrons congregating to attend and leave the venue.</p>

                <p>“(C) Unusual and significant increases in foot or vehicular traffic within or surrounding the entrance of a commercial building, place of public assembly, establishment required to have a license under D.C. Official Code § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/25-102.html">25-102</a>, school, public hall or any establishment or private function, or parking lots regularly used to attend functions at these places.</p>
                <p>“(4) ‘Venue operator’ means an individual, corporation or proprietorship with a license to hold an event for-profit at an establishment that leads to congestion surrounding the venue.”</p>
                <p>“Sec. 3. Responsibility of venue operators.</p>
                <p>“All regular venue operators shall meet with the Metropolitan Police Department (‘MPD’) to develop an agreement with the MPD when holding a function for profit that leads to an unusual and significant increase in foot or vehicular traffic to and from the police service area where the venue is located. This agreement shall:</p>
                <p>“(1) Provide procedures for the venue operator to inform the MPD when congestion of city streets within the police service area where the venue is located is expected to occur;</p>

Where a venue results in unusual and significant increases in vehicular or foot traffic and congestion of city streets, the MPD may establish a detail and charge the venue operator or group of venue operators for the presence of those MPD officers required to maintain the flow of traffic and public safety within the police service area where the venue is located.</p>
                <p>“(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Metropolitan Police Department to charge operators of not-for-profit events for MPD details at a venue or within the police service area where the venue is located.”</p>
                <p>Section 6(b) of D.C. Law 15-201 provided that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</p>
