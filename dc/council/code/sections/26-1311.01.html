The successor fiduciary shall have all the rights and duties of the predecessor fiduciary. Unless otherwise provided in the document or instrument, the successor fiduciary shall be automatically named as fiduciary in all writings, wills, trusts, court orders, or similar documents or instruments that name the predecessor fiduciary as fiduciary, whether signed before or after the successor fiduciary is created or succeeds to the trust business of the predecessor fiduciary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> For the purposes of qualification as a fiduciary or a successor fiduciary under any requirement contained in any document creating or relating to a fiduciary capacity, the successor bank, trust company, bank holding company, or subsidiary trust company is considered to have capital and surplus equal to its capital and surplus plus the capital and surplus of its owning bank, bank holding company, and their affiliates.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Not less than 30 days before the succession becomes effective under this section, the successor fiduciary shall publish notice of the succession in a newspaper of general circulation in the District and shall mail the notice to each co-fiduciary of the successor fiduciary, to each surviving settlor of a trust, to each person who alone or in conjunction with others has the power to remove the fiduciary, to each beneficiary of a trust, estate, or fund, and to the Superintendent of Banking and Financial Institutions [Commissioner of the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking] of the District of Columbia. In the case of a trust described in chapter 736 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. § 401(a)), notice shall be mailed to the employer, employee organization, or both, responsible for the maintenance of the trust. Notice shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the addressee and shall contain the name of the predecessor fiduciary, the name of the successor fiduciary, and the effective date of the assumption of fiduciary responsibilities by the successor fiduciary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Within 180 days after succession under this section, a co-fiduciary, settlor of a trust, beneficiary, guardian, conservator, committee, or any other person authorized to remove a fiduciary, may apply to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia (“Court”) for the appointment of a new fiduciary to replace the successor fiduciary. The Court may appoint a new fiduciary to replace the successor fiduciary if it finds, after notice to all parties in interest and a hearing, that the successor fiduciary will adversely affect the administration of the fiduciary account and that the appointment of a new fiduciary will be in the best interest of the petitioner and all interested parties. This provision shall be in addition to any other provision of law governing the removal of a fiduciary and shall be subject to the terms upon which the original fiduciary was designated as fiduciary.</p>
