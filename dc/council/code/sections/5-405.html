                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Firefighting Division shall operate under a 2-shift system and all hours of duty of any shift shall be consecutive.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The Mayor of the District of Columbia is further authorized and directed to establish a workweek for officers and members of the Fire Department, other than those in the Firefighting Division, of 40 hours, and the hours of work in such workweek shall be performed on consecutive days in such workweek: Provided, that notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the Mayor of the District of Columbia or his designated agent or agents may, whenever the exigencies of the Fire Department require temporary or short-term services of 1 or more officers or members, order such officer, officers, member, or members to perform such services.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The days off duty to which each officer or member of the Fire Department is entitled shall be in addition to his annual leave and sick leave allowed by law. In the case of any shift of the Fire Department beginning on 1 day and extending without a break in continuity into the next day, or in the case of 2 shifts beginning on the same day, the Mayor is authorized to designate the shift which shall be the workday, and the entire shift so designated shall be considered the workday for all pay and leave purposes.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> If a holiday shall fall on any day off of any officer or member of the Fire Department, he shall be excused from duty on such other day as is designated by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and if he is required to be on duty in lieu of such day off, he shall receive compensation for such duty at the rate provided by law for duty performed on a holiday. When any shift of the Fire Department begins on the day before a holiday and extends without a break in continuity into the holiday, or begins on a holiday and extends without a break in continuity into the next day, the Mayor of the District of Columbia is authorized to designate either of such shifts as the holiday workday, and the entire shift so designated shall be considered as the holiday workday for all pay and leave purposes. As used in this subsection, the word “holiday” shall have the same meaning as such word has in § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/5-521.02.html">5-521.02</a>, and as supplemented by § 6103 of Title 5, United States Code.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> For Fiscal Year 2015, no member of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, except for officers, shall work more than 228 hours in 2 consecutive pay periods.</p>
