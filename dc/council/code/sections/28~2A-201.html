    </p>
                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>1981 Ed., § 28:2A-201.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p><strong>Uniform Statutory Source:</strong>Sections 2-201,  9-203(1) and  9-110.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes:</strong> This section is modeled on  Section 2-201, with changes to reflect the differences between a lease contract and a contract for the sale of goods. In particular, subsection (1)(b) adds a requirement that the writing “describe the goods leased and the lease term“, borrowing that concept, with revisions, from the provisions of  Section 9-203(1)(a). Subsection (2), relying on the statutory analogue in  Section 9-110, sets forth the minimum criterion for satisfying that requirement.</p>
                <p><strong>Purposes:</strong> The changes in this section conform the provisions of  Section 2-201 to custom and usage in lease transactions.  Section 2-201(2), stating a special rule between merchants, was not included in this section as the number of such transactions involving leases, as opposed to sales, was thought to be modest. Subsection (4) creates no exception for transactions where payment has been made and accepted. This represents a departure from the analogue,  Section 2-201(3)(c). The rationale for the departure is grounded in the distinction between sales and leases. Unlike a buyer in a sales transaction, the lessee does not tender payment in full for goods delivered, but only payment of rent for one or more months. It was decided that, as a matter of policy, this act of payment is not a sufficient substitute for the required memorandum. Subsection (5) was needed to establish the criteria for supplying the lease term if it is omitted, as the lease contract may still be enforceable under subsection (4).</p>
