                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> Notwithstanding §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-1205.html">42-1205</a> [repealed] and 42-1212, there is established in the Treasury of the District of Columbia a fund to be known as the Recorder of Deeds Automation and Infrastructure Improvement Fund (“Fund”) into which shall be deposited all funds collected pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/42-1211.html">42-1211</a>. The Recorder of Deeds Automation and Infrastructure Improvement Fund shall be a fund as defined in §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-373.html">47-373</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-876.html">47-876</a>, and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1304.html">47-1304</a>(h). All interest earned on monies deposited in the Fund shall be credited to the Fund established herein, and used solely for the purposes designated in this section and as described in subsection (b-1) of this section. Revenues in the Fund shall remain available for expenditure without regard to fiscal year limitation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Revenues accruing to the Fund shall be used solely and exclusively to cover the costs of updating the automated system of the Recorder of Deeds and the repair and improvement of the infrastructure located at 515 D Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., and any incidental costs associated with that repair and improvement. These costs shall include the purchasing of computer hardware and software, maintenance of the new computer system, training staff to implement and operate the new system, and the repair of the infrastructure components necessary to meet the overall mission of the Recorder of Deeds.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b-1)</span> Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, revenues accounted for and deposited into the Fund under the authority of §§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-876.html">47-876</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/47-1340.html">47-1340</a>(h), together with interest accruing thereon, shall be used solely and exclusively by the Real Property Tax Administration of the Office of Tax and Revenue for the purposes under which the revenue was charged and collected.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> For purposes of this section, the term “infrastructure components” means the air and heating systems, elevator, roof, ceilings, windows, doors, walls, plumbing, floors, basement, electrical system, mechanical systems, and other similar components that make up the improvements located at 515 D Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The Mayor shall submit to the Council, as part of the annual budget, a requested appropriation for expenditures for the restricted purposes designated in subsections (b) and (b-1) of this section from the Fund. The request shall include an accounting of the use of funds from the Fund in the previous fiscal year. Appropriations from the Fund shall remain available until expended. Any revenue received, but not appropriated in a given fiscal year, shall be retained by the Fund.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or limit the appropriation of additional funds from the revenues of the District for the operations of the Real Property Tax Administration of the Office of Tax and Revenue, including appropriations to support the purposes specified in subsections (b) and (b-1) of this section. The revenues accruing to the Fund shall be considered as supplementing and enhancing the operations of the Real Property Tax Administration of the Office of Tax and Revenue, and are not intended to be used to supplant support for the Real Property Tax Administration of the Office of Tax and Revenue provided through the general funds of the District.</p>
