                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Subject to subsection (e) of this section, a note is paid to the extent payment is made by or on behalf of a party obliged to pay the note to a person that formerly was entitled to enforce the note only if at the time of the payment the party obliged to pay has not received adequate notification that the note has been transferred and that payment is to be made to the transferee. A notification is adequate only if it is signed by the transferor or the transferee, reasonably identifies the transferred note, and provides an address at which subsequent payments are to be made. Upon request, a transferee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the note has been transferred. Unless the transferee complies with the request, a payment to the person that formerly was entitled to enforce the note is effective for purposes of subsection (c) of this section even if the party obliged to pay the note has received a notification under this section.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> Subject to subsection (e) of this section, a transferee, or any party that has acquired rights in the instrument directly or indirectly from a transferee, including any such party that has rights as a holder in due course, is deemed to have notice of any payment that is made under subsection (b) of this section after the date that the note is transferred to the transferee but before the party obliged to pay the note receives adequate notification of the transfer.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> The obligation of a party to pay the instrument is not discharged under subsections (a) through (d) of this section if:</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> The person making payment knows that the instrument is a stolen instrument and pays a person it knows is in wrongful possession of the instrument.</p>
