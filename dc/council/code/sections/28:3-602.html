                      <div class="line" style="text-indent: 1.5em">This section replaces former  Section 3-603(1). The phrase “claim to the instrument” in subsection (a) means, by reference to  Section 3-306, a claim of ownership or possession and not a claim in recoupment. Subsection (b)(1)(ii) is added to conform to  Section 3-411.  Section 3-411 is intended to discourage an obligated bank from refusing payment of a cashier’s check, certified check or dishonored teller’s check at the request of a claimant to the check who provided the bank with indemnity against loss. See Comment 1 to  Section 3-411. An obligated bank that refuses payment under those circumstances not only remains liable on the check but may also be liable to the holder of the check for consequential damages.  Section 3-602(b)(1)(ii) and  Section 3-411, read together, change the rule of former  Section 3-603(1) with respect to the obligation of the obligated bank on the check. Payment to the holder of a cashier’s check, teller’s check, or certified check discharges the obligation of the obligated bank on the check to both the holder and the claimant even though indemnity has been given by the person asserting the claim. If the obligated bank pays the check in violation of an agreement with the claimant in connection with the indemnity agreement, any liability that the bank may have for violation of the agreement is not governed by Article 3, but is left to other law. This section continues the rule that the obligor is not discharged on the instrument if payment is made in violation of an injunction against payment. See  Section 3-411(c)(iv).</div>
