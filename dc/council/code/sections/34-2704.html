The notification shall be accomplished by the person notifying the one-call center, in any manner approved by the one-call center, within the time limit, and the one-call center shall, in turn, notify the appropriate utility operators.</p>

The method of identifying the location shall conform to standards and requirements, including the use of the color-coding system, established in regulations issued by the Mayor.</p>

Three days before the end of the 15-day period, or at any time when line-location markings on the ground become illegible, the person excavating or demolishing shall contact the one-call center and request the re-marking of the lines. The utility operator shall re-mark the lines as soon as possible. However, the re-marking of the lines shall be completed within 48 hours from the time of the request.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> For the purposes of this section, a District of Columbia agency or instrumentality shall mark buried infrastructure for traffic operations, including streetlights and traffic signals.</p>
