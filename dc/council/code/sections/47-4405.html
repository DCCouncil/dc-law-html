Before contracting with a collection agency, the Mayor shall send the taxpayer at least one written notice, by certified or registered mail, to the taxpayer’s last known mailing address requesting payment. The notice shall state that the matter of the taxpayer’s delinquency may be referred to a collection agency. The taxpayer shall have 30 days from the date of mailing of the certified or registered notice to pay, in full, the delinquent taxes before the delinquent account is referred to a collection agency.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> All funds collected by the collection agency shall be remitted to the Mayor not less than once a month. Forms to be utilized for the remittances may be prescribed by the Mayor. The Mayor may require that the collection agency furnish a bond securing compliance with the provisions of this subsection and the contract with the District of Columbia.</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys’ or agents’ fees, shall be the responsibility of the delinquent taxpayer.

If the tax return or other information is provided to a collection agency under this subsection, the collection agency shall not disclose the information to a third party, other than the taxpayer (or his or her representative), unless the Mayor would be authorized by law to make the disclosure. A collection agency, or employee of a collection agency, violating the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than the amount set forth in [§ <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/22-3571.01.html">22-3571.01</a>], or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both. All prosecutions under this paragraph shall be brought in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on information by the Attorney General for the District of Columbia in the name of the District of Columbia.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> If the Mayor does not contract with a collection agency inside or outside the District of Columbia, for the collection of delinquent taxes due from a taxpayer, a collection fee not in excess of 25% may be charged by the District as set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
