If any party shall apply to the Court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the Court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Mayor, the Court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Mayor, and to be made part of the record.
