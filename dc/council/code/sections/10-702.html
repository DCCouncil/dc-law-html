If the analysis reveals the presence of lead-based paint hazards, as identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 40 C.F.R. § 745.65(a) through (c), the Mayor shall cause the lead condition to be repaired or controlled; provided, that the repairs and controls shall be of a sufficient quality to equal or exceed that required of private housing located in the District of Columbia pursuant to regulations promulgated with respect to housing in the District of Columbia.</p>

If the analysis reveals the presence of lead or lead compounds in a quantity in excess of 1 milligram per square centimeter of surface or in a quantity otherwise sufficient to constitute a hazard to the health of any user of the building, the Mayor shall cause the lead condition to be repaired; provided, that the repairs shall be of a sufficient quality to equal or exceed that required of private housing located in the District of Columbia pursuant to regulations promulgated with respect to housing in the District of Columbia.”</p>
