                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> A certificate of birth for each live birth which occurs in the District shall be filed as directed by the Registrar, within 5 days after such birth, and shall be registered if it has been completed and filed in accordance with this chapter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> When a birth occurs in or en route to an institution the person in charge of the institution or his or her designee shall collect the personal data, prepare the certificate, secure the signatures required, and file the certificate. The physician or other person in attendance at or immediately after the birth shall provide the medical information required in the certificate and certify to the facts of birth within 72 hours after the birth. If the physician, or other person in attendance at or immediately after the birth, does not certify to the facts of birth within the 72-hour period, the person in charge of the institution or his or her designee shall certify to the facts of birth and complete the certificate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> When a birth occurs outside an institution, the certificate shall be prepared and filed by one of the following persons in the indicated order of priority:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The physician in attendance at the time of birth or in attendance immediately after the birth;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any other person in attendance at the time of birth or in attendance immediately after the birth; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> The mother, the father, the spouse or domestic partner of the mother, or, in the absence of the father or the spouse or domestic partner of the mother, and the inability of the mother, the person in charge of the premises where the birth occurred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> When a birth occurs on a moving conveyance within the United States and the child is first removed from the conveyance in the District, the birth shall be registered in the District, and the place where it is first removed shall be considered the place of birth. When a birth occurs on a moving conveyance while in international waters, air space, in a foreign country or its air space,  and the child is first removed from the conveyance in the District, the birth shall be registered in the District, but the certificate shall show the actual place of birth insofar as can be determined.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> For the purposes of preparation and filing a birth certificate the following rules apply:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2A)</span> If the mother was in a domestic partnership at the time of either conception or birth, or between conception and birth, the name of the domestic partner of the mother shall be entered on the certificate as a parent of the child, unless parentage has been determined otherwise by the Court pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-909.html">16-909</a>;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> If the mother was not married or in a domestic partnership at the time of either conception or birth, or between conception and birth, the name of the other parent shall only be entered on the certificate if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The parents have signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity pursuant to § <cite path="§16-909.1">16-909.1</cite>(a)(1) or pursuant to the laws and procedures of another state in which the voluntary acknowledgment was signed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The parents have signed a consent to parent a child born by artificial insemination pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/16-909.html">16-909</a>(e) and paragraph (3A) of this subsection; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> Acknowledges consent by the mother and the intended parent to the insemination with the intent to be a parent of the child:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> Is signed under oath (which may include signature in the presence of a notary);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Includes written notice that legal consequences, rights, and responsibilities as a parent arise from signing the consent; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> The surname of the child shall be the surname of a parent whose name appears on the child’s birth certificate, or both surnames recorded in any order or in hyphenated or unhyphenated form, or any surname to which either parent has a familial connection. If the chosen surname is not that of a parent, or a combination of all or part of both surnames, either or both parents shall provide an affidavit stating that the chosen surname was or is the surname of a past or current relative or has some other clearly stated familial connection. Submission of an affidavit containing false information shall be punishable under § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/7-225.html">7-225</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Either of the parents of the child, or other informant, shall confirm with his or her signature the accuracy of the personal data entered on the certificate before the certificate is filed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Any institutional error regarding the personal data on the certificate may be corrected within 90 days of issuance, and:</p>
