                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Commissioner shall issue a renewal license to any U.S. Branch if satisfied, by such proof as required, that the insurer is not delinquent with respect to any requirement imposed by this chapter and that its continuance in business in the District will not be hazardous or prejudicial to the best interest of the people of the District.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> No U.S. Branch shall be licensed to do in the District any kind of insurance business, or any combination of kinds of insurance business, which are not permitted to be done by domestic insurers licensed under the provisions of this chapter. No U.S. Branch shall be authorized to do an insurance business in the District if it does anywhere within the United States any kind of business other than an insurance business and the business necessarily or properly incidental to the kinds of insurance business which it is authorized to do in the District.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> No U.S. Branch that does outside of the District any kind or combination of kinds of insurance business not permitted to be done in the District by similar domestic insurers hereafter organized shall be or continue to be authorized to do an insurance business in the District, unless in the judgment of the Commissioner the doing of such kind or combination of kinds of insurance business will not be prejudicial to the best interest of the people of the District.</p>
