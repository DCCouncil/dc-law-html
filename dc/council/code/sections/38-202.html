This obligation of the parent, guardian, or other person having custody extends until the minor reaches the age of 18 years.

                    <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> Any minor who has reached the age of 17 years may be allowed flexible school hours by the Superintendent of Schools provided he or she is actually, lawfully, gainfully, and regularly employed, but in no case shall he or she be excused entirely from regular attendance or excused to the extent that his or her timely graduation would be jeopardized or prevented.</p>
