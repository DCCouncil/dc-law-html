Except as provided in subsection (a-1) of this section, the Fund shall be comprised of general revenue funds appropriated by a line item in the budget submitted pursuant to § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-204.46.html">1-204.46</a>, and authorized by Congress in an appropriations act for the purpose of the Drug Treatment Choice Program.  The Mayor shall, subject to authorization by Congress in an appropriations act, deposit in the Fund any and all other funds received on behalf of the Fund for the purpose of the Drug Treatment Choice Program.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> All funds shall be deposited into the Fund without regard to fiscal year limitation pursuant to an act of Congress. All funds deposited into the Fund shall not revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of any fiscal year or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the purpose of the Drug Treatment Choice Program, subject to authorization by Congress in an appropriations act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a-1)">(a-1)</span> There is established within the Fund a segregated account to be known as the ATR Account, into which shall be deposited the federal grant funds awarded to APRA for ATR, to be expended solely for the purposes of ATR, in accordance with federal requirements and regulations promulgated to implement this chapter.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The plan developed by APRA pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be submitted by the Mayor to the Council for a 45-day period of review, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days of Council recess. If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed plan, in whole or in part, by resolution within this 45-day review period, the proposed plan shall be deemed approved.</p>
