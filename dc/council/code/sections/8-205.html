                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority of the District of Columbia is authorized to repair and maintain and, where necessary, to renew all water service pipes and building sewers from the water main or the public sewer to the property line of each lot in the District of Columbia required to be so connected by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/8-201.html">8-201</a> at the costs of such owner or owners and to perform all such repairs, as are necessary, to maintain or improve any roadway, alley, minor street, highway or other public space above such repaired or renewed water service pipes or building sewers. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, where he deems such action necessary, may also perform maintenance or repair work on private property, in which case, the cost, including overhead expense, shall be paid by the property owner. The cost of any repair or maintenance work on water service pipes or building sewers beyond the property line away from the house or structure, made necessary by the negligence or through the action of a property owner or tenant as reasonably determined by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, shall be charged to the property owner.</p>

Compensation shall be in the form of payment or the removal of a lien or assessment against such property by the District of Columbia only to owners who establish under the requirements of subsection (e) of this section proof of actual payment of repairs under a permit issued by the District of Columbia. All rights to compensation under the terms of this subsection shall terminate 2 years from March 29, 1977.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> All prior year compensation payments authorized by subsection (c) of this section and all work required to be done in the repair, maintenance, or renewal of water service pipes and building sewer as authorized under subsection (b) of this section, including surface repair works, shall be paid from the Water and Sewer Authority Enterprise Fund established by § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/34-2202.07.html">34-2202.07</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Before compensation is granted, the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority shall determine whether the repair, made under a permit issued by the District of Columbia, would have been authorized under subsection (b) of this section, noting such other pertinent findings of fact as he deems necessary. If the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority determines that the repair work would have been eligible under subsection (b) of this section had it been in effect at the time of repair, he shall compensate any person, who was the property owner at the time the repairs were made, for the cost of such repairs, provided such owner can establish proof of payment for the cost of the repairs to the reasonable satisfaction of the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority up to the full value thereof for each separate occurrence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Any person who by means of false statement, or impersonation, or by other fraudulent device obtains or attempts to obtain or any person who knowingly aids or abets such person in obtaining or attempting to obtain: (1) Any award or payment of compensation under the provisions of this section to which he is not entitled; or (2) a larger amount or greater relief in compensation than that to which he is entitled; shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $500 or imprisoned not to exceed 1 year, or both. Prosecutions under the provisions of this subsection shall be in the name of the District of Columbia by the Office of the Corporation Counsel.</p>
