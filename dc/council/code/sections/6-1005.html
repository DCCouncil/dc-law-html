A proposed disposition shall be in accordance with § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/10-801.html">10-801</a>(c)-(e). Each proposed disposition shall be submitted to the Council for approval, in whole or in part, by resolution.</p>

If the Council does not approve or disapprove the proposed disposition of the property, in whole or in part, by resolution within the 90-day period, the proposed resolution shall be deemed approved. Nothing in this section shall affect any requirements imposed upon the Mayor by subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2.</p>

If the Mayor determines before the end of the one-year period that the property cannot be disposed of, or that an exclusive right agreement pertaining to the property cannot be executed, within the one-year period, the Mayor may submit to the Council, no later than 30 days, not including Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays or days of Council recess, before the end of the one-year period, a resolution seeking additional time for the execution of an exclusive right agreement pertaining to the property. The resolution shall include a detailed status report on efforts made toward execution of an exclusive right agreement pertaining to the property and the reasons for the inability to execute an exclusive right agreement pertaining to the property within the one-year period. If the Council does not take action to approve or disapprove the resolution within 30 days of receipt of the resolution, not including Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, or days of Council recess, the resolution shall be deemed approved.</p>

                  <p class="text-indent-5"><span class="level-num">(II)</span> The Mayor grants an extension of the expiration date, not to exceed 12 months. An extension shall be based on a determination that special factors exist justifying the extension. Factors considered shall include the need for zoning changes, historic preservation, street and alley closings, abatement of environmental hazards, and taking by eminent domain.</p>

The resolution shall include a detailed status report on efforts made toward disposition of the property and the reasons for the inability to dispose of the property within the two-year period.
