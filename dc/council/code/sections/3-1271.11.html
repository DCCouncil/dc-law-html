                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The purpose of the interstate commission is the administration of the Compact, which is a discretionary state function.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The interstate commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the member states and shall have all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth in the Compact, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by a subsequent concurrent action of the respective legislatures of the member states in accordance with the terms of the Compact.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The interstate commission shall consist of 2 voting representatives appointed by each member state who shall serve as Commissioners.  In states where allopathic and osteopathic physicians are regulated by separate member boards, or if the licensing and disciplinary authority is split between multiple member boards within a member state, the member state shall appoint one representative from each member board.  A Commissioner shall be:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The bylaws may provide for meetings of the interstate commission to be conducted by telecommunication or electronic communication.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Each commissioner participating at a meeting of the interstate commission is entitled to one vote.  A majority of commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the interstate commission.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(5)">(5)</span> Discuss information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(6)">(6)</span> Discuss investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes; or</p>
