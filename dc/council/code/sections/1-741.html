and</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Mayor after consultation with federal and state supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of the retirement program. Such ancillary services shall not be provided at more than reasonable compensation;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(4)</span> The exercise of a privilege to convert securities, to the extent provided in regulations of the Council, but only if the Fund receives no less than adequate consideration pursuant to such conversion; or</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(5)</span> Any transaction between a Fund and a common or collective trust fund or pooled investment fund maintained by a party in interest which is a bank or trust company supervised by a state or federal agency, or a pooled investment fund of an insurance company qualified to do business in a state, if:</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(A)</span> The transaction is a sale or purchase of an interest in the fund;</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(B)</span> The bank, trust company, or insurance company receives not more than reasonable compensation; and</p><p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num">(C)</span> Such transaction is expressly permitted by the Board, or by a fiduciary (other than the bank, trust company, insurance company, or an affiliate thereof) who has authority to manage and control the assets of the Fund.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> Nothing in subsection (c) of this section shall be construed to prohibit any fiduciary from:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Receiving any benefit to which he may be entitled as a participant or beneficiary in the retirement program, so long as the benefit is computed and paid on a basis which is consistent with the terms of the retirement program as applied to all other participants and beneficiaries;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> Receiving any reasonable compensation for services rendered, or for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred, in the performance of his duties with respect to the Fund; or</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Serving as a fiduciary in addition to being an officer, employee, agent, or other representative of a party in interest.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h)</span> The Board may from time to time avail itself to exemptive relief from all or part of the restrictions imposed by subsections (c) and (d) of this section for administrative exemptions which have been previously granted by the United States Department of Labor. Prior to utilizing exempted transactions, the Board shall hold a public hearing on the proposed exemption. Notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the public hearing shall be published in the D.C. Register at least 15 days in advance of its scheduled date in order to afford interested persons an opportunity to present their views. The proposed exemption shall be published in the D.C. Register and submitted to the Council along with a synopsis of the results of the public hearing, and written findings by the Board that the exemptions are:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Administratively feasible;</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> In the best interests of the funds and of their participants and beneficiaries; and</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(3)</span> Protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of these funds.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(h-1)</span> Unless the Council disapproves the proposed exemption submitted under subsection (h) of this section by resolution within 30 days of receipt by the Council, the exemption shall be deemed approved. If a resolution of disapproval has been introduced by at least one member of the Council within the 5-day period (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) following its receipt, the period of Council review shall be extended by an additional 15 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the date of its receipt. If the resolution of disapproval has not been approved within the 15-day extended period, the proposed exemption shall be deemed approved.</p><p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(i)</span> For purposes of subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the assets of a Fund shall not include assets in a pooled separate account of an insurance company qualified to do business in a state or assets in a collective investment fund of a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or any state, provided that:</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> The interest of all Funds in the separate account or collective investment fund does not exceed 5% of the total of all assets in the account or fund; and</p><p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num">(2)</span> At the time a transaction that would otherwise be prohibited by subsection (c) or (d) of this section is entered into, and at the time of any subsequent renewal which requires the approval of the bank or insurance company, the terms of the transaction are not less favorable to the pooled separate account or collective investment fund than the terms generally available in an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties.</p></section><br/><section class="line-group annotations"><p>
