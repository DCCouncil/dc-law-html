    </p>
                <h4>Prior Codifications</h4>
                <p>1981 Ed., § 28:4-209.</p>
                <h4>Uniform Commercial Code Comment</h4>
                <p>1. Encoding and retention warranties are included in Article 4 because they are unique to the bank collection process. These warranties are breached only by the person doing the encoding or retaining the item and not by subsequent banks handling the item. Encoding and check retention may be done by customers who are payees of a large volume of checks; hence, this section imposes warranties on customers as well as banks. If a customer encodes or retains, the depositary bank is also liable for any breach of this warranty.</p>
                <p>2. A misencoding of the amount on the MICR line is not an alteration under  Section 3-407(a) which defines alteration as changing the contract of the parties. If a drawer wrote a check for $2,500 and the depositary bank encoded $25,000 on the MICR line, the payor bank could debit the drawer’s account for only $2,500. This subsection would allow the payor bank to hold the depositary bank liable for the amount paid out over $2,500 without first pursuing the person who received payment. Intervening collecting banks would not be liable to the payor bank for the depositary bank’s error. If a drawer wrote a check for $25,000 and the depositary bank encoded $2,500, the payor bank becomes liable for the full amount of the check. The payor bank’s rights against the depositary bank depend on whether the payor bank has suffered a loss. Since the payor bank can debit the drawer’s account for $25,000, the payor bank has a loss only to the extent that the drawer’s account is less than the full amount of the check. There is no requirement that the payor bank pursue collection against the drawer beyond the amount in the drawer’s account as a condition to the payor bank’s action against the depositary bank for breach of warranty.  See Georgia Railroad Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. First National Bank &amp; Trust, 229 S.E.2d 482 (Ga.App.1976)235 S.E.2d 1 (Ga.1977), and  First National Bank of Boston v. Fidelity Bank, National Association, 724 F.Supp. 1168 (E.D.Pa.1989).</p>
                <p>3. A person retaining items under an electronic presentment agreement ( Section 4-110) warrants that it has complied with the terms of the agreement regarding its possession of the item and its sending a proper presentment notice. If the keeper is a customer, its depositary bank also makes this warranty.</p>
