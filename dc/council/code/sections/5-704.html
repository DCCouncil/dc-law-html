If in the case of the individual or the surviving spouse such military service is not excluded under the preceding sentence, but upon attaining retirement age (as defined in § 216(a) of the Social Security Act) he or she becomes entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled) to such benefits, the District of Columbia Retirement Board shall re-determine the aggregate period of service upon which such annuity is based, effective as of the 1st day of the month in which he or she attains such age, so as to exclude such service.

The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence of basic pay for military service as the member may provide, or, if the District of Columbia Retirement Board determines sufficient evidence has not been so provided to adequately determine basic pay for military service, such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay provided to the District of Columbia Retirement Board under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. Payment of such amount by an active member must be completed prior to the member’s date of retirement or October 1, 2006, whichever is later, for the member to retain credit for the service.</p>

                <h4>Change in Government</h4>
                <p>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.11.html">1-207.11</a>), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act ( D.C. Code, § <a class="internal-link" href="/dc/council/code/sections/1-207.14.html">1-207.14</a>(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</p>
