                <h4>Effect of Amendments</h4>
                <p>The 2013 amendment by <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/20-60.html">D.C. Law 20-60</a> added (a)(1A); and substituted “for Chairman of the Council, each member of the Council, Mayor, Attorney General” for “for Mayor, Chairman of the Council, each member of the Council” in (b)(1).</p>
                <p>The 2014 amendment by <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/20-79.html">D.C. Law 20-79</a> would have rewritten this section.</p>
                <h4>Applicability</h4>
                <p>Applicability of <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/22-250.html">D.C. Law 22-250</a>: <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/22-250.html#§10">§ 10 of D.C. Law 22-250</a> provided that the change made to this section by <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/22-250.html#§6(oo)">§ 6(oo) of D.C. Law 22-250</a> is subject to the inclusion of the law’s fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore that amendment has not been implemented.</p>
                <p><a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/21-160.html#§7009">Section 7009 of D.C. Law 21-160</a> repealed <a class="internal-link " href="/dc/council/laws/20-79.html#§3">§ 3 of D.C. Law 20-79</a>. Therefore the changes made to this section by D.C. Law 20-79 have been given effect.
